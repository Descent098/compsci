The "brain" of the computer. This is what essentially tells your computer what to do, and helps coordinates operations between other parts of your computer. There are a few important specifications to understand:
  - Instruction size; This is essentially the amount of space each instruction in a CPU has to work with. 32 bit programs will run on 32 bit and 64 bit systems, but 64 bit programs will ONLY run on 64 bit systems
    - 32Bit
    - 64Bit
  - It's important to note 3 common architectures that are used
    - x86; Most intel and AMD chips are x86 (often called by 86)
    - ARM; A lower-power architecture used in many phones and also new M series macbooks
    - RISC & RISC 5; An open source alternative used by some companies like IBM with the intention of simplicity of system
  - Level Caches; This is a system that allows a CPU to store small bits of information to process them quickly. The lower the "level", the less storage space, but the faster it is. These are typically denoted as something like L3 (level 3) 32MB, L2 (level 2) 8MB, L1 (level 1) 3.5MB. This system is a form of Volatile storage, this implies that it requires electricity to store it's data, this means when the electricity stops runing through it all the data is lost
