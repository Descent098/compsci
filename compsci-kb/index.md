## About the Site
Welcome to my computer science KB. The purpose of this project is to be a [knowledge base](https://www.atlassian.com/itsm/knowledge-management/what-is-a-knowledge-base#:~:text=A%20knowledge%20base%20is%20a,and%20expand%20the%20knowledge%20base.) for all things computer science. Most of this is information I have come across and used. The information is broken up into various sections by field to make it easy to find things, but also don't be afraid to use the search bar since the site has [full-text search](https://www.mongodb.com/basics/full-text-search#:~:text=Unlike%20traditional%20search%20methods%20that,citation%2C%20or%20additional%20text%20attributes.) to make finding whatever you need as easy as possible!

### Navigation
When navigating through to any new topic in the knowledge base I would recommend checking out the page labelled `ðŸŒ±Basics/Intro` in each section.  From there there is also (on desktop) a graph view in the top right (should be at the bottom of the page on mobile) to see which pages are related to the current page. Many times the related pages are in different sections and are worth checking out when they come up. Additionally at the bottom of most pages there is an **additional resources** section which includes references to alternate explanations, expansions on the topic, or examples of the topic in the real world.
## About Me
Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Kieran. 

I'm currently a computer science student with a minor in philosophy at the university of Calgary in Canada. I've been developing since I started my degree professionally as both a freelancer and full-time employee, as well as doing open source work.
