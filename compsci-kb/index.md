Welcome to my computer science KB. The purpose of this project is to be a [knowledge base]() for all things computer science. Most of this is information I have come across and used. The information is broken up into various sections by field to make it easy to find things, but also don't be afraid to use the search bar since the site has [full-text search]() to make finding whatever you need as easy as possible!

## About Me
Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Kieran. 

I'm currently a computer science student with a minor in philosophy at the university of Calgary in Canada. I've been developing since I started my degree professionally as both a freelancer and full-time employee, as well as doing open source work. If you're interested in some of my other projects check out some of the links in the footer of the site!
