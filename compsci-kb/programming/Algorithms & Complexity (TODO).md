## Simple patterns (TODO)
These patterns are ones you will often see people do even if they've never looked at algorithms before.

### String Building (TODO)
The idea of the string builder pattern is to treat a string like an [[Programming/Basics#Array's & Lists (TODO)|array/list]] and continuously push substrings into the string in order to build the result slowly.
