### Purely Object Oriented Languages
Some languages will only allow you to create and interface with objects.

#### Squeak/Smalltalk
[Smalltalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk#:~:text=Smalltalk%20is%20a%20purely%20object,later%20found%20use%20in%20business.) was a language created in the 1970's. It was one of the first object-oriented languages, and influenced most other object oriented languages that came afterwards. Since then [Squeak](https://squeak.org/) is the more modern implementation of Smalltalk. Every piece of data in Smalltalk is an object (including the window of your environment). You cannot have functions, only methods! "methods" (attached to objects) are passed "messages" (objects) which carry out operations. 

Both are esoteric in how you use them. Your IDE is part of your program, and everything (including the IDE state) is saved to a file. I am using squeak in the examples and as a tip if you want to test the examples you see below, left-click inside the window and select `Worspace`, this is where you enter your code. From there left click again in the empty space and open `Transcript`. Type your code in the workspace window, highlight it and hit `alt/option + d` to run it, or hit `alt/option + p` to print the result inline.

For example here is hello world in squeak can be done a few ways:
```smalltalk
Transcript show: 'Hello World'.
```

![[squeak-hello-world-2.png]]
`Transcript` is an object representing the transcript window. We are then using the `show`  method with the string object `'Hello World'`. Alternatively we could also do:

```smalltalk
self inform: 'Hello World'.
```

![[squeak-hello-world.png]]
`self` is the object representing the window you type your code into, and `inform` is a method that creates a new dialogue box, which takes in a string message to show. 

This leaves us with some interesting consequences. For example there are no conditional statements, instead you create a Boolean object as the result of an expression, then check against it's `ifTrue` and `ifFalse` values:
```smalltalk
3 > 5
	ifTrue: Transcript show: 'It is Greater'
	ifFalse: Transcript show: 'It is Smaller'

```

It's more clear if we assign the Boolean to a variable `result`:

```smalltalk
t := 3 > 5.
	t ifTrue: [Transcript show: 'It is Greater'].
	t ifFalse: [Transcript show: 'It is Smaller'].
```

![[squeak-booleans.png]]
Because of this design there are a few ways to do loops that also feel a bit odd. For example in this case the integer 10 is getting a `timesRepeat` signal, which then executes the statements in `[]` that many times:
```smalltalk
10 timesRepeat: [Transcript show: 'hello' ]
```
So we would get `hellohellohellohellohellohellohellohellohellohello` as output. Alternatively we could send a `to` signal, which we can then send a message of another integer object, with a `do` signal in order to execute the statement in `[]`[^1]:

```smalltalk
result := String new.
1 to: 10 do: [:n | result := result , n , ' '].
Transcript show: result 
```

![[squeak-loops.png]]
This code assigns `n` the current value of the loop, then combines it to the `result` string with a space. This follows a similar convention to [set-builder notation](https://www.purplemath.com/modules/setnotn.htm#:~:text=In%20set%2Dbuilder%20notation%2C%20the%20previous%20set%20looks%20like%20this%3A) or [list comprehensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_comprehension) but the resulting data is thrown away after being serialized into `result`
#### Java

Another purely object-oriented language is Java. Created in 1995 as a general purpose language, largely used for enterprise applications today. I have included several examples for code, to run these I would highly recommend downloading an openJDK version. You can choose between [amazon's version (Corretto))](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/?filtered-posts.sort-by=item.additionalFields.createdDate&filtered-posts.sort-order=desc) or [adoptJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk16&jvmVariant=hotspot). You can also install it via [ninite](https://ninite.com/) (which is what I do). Once installed just add the examples to a `.java` file and then compile using `javac *.java` then run the program with the entrypoint name (explained later), if it's a class called `Main` in a file called `Main.java` then you would run `javac *.java` then run `java Main`.

With Java you explicitly create a "[singleton](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton)" (a class with only 1 instance), which is an object representing your program. Here is the "hello world" in Java:

```java
class HelloWorld{  
    public static void main(String []args){  
        System.out.println("Hello World");  
    }  
};
```
This code would live inside a file called `HelloWorld.java`, we would then compile and run it. From there Java will create an instance of the `HelloWorld` class and run it's `main` method. These singletons are always the entrypoint (where a program runs from) in a java program. 

Though it's not strictly enforced most java programs will have you create a single class per file, and usually the class name and file name will be the same. Your entrypoint file will then use your other files to do things. For example consider this file (`Greeter.java`):

```java
class Greeter{
  
	  private String name;
	  
	  public Greeter(String name) {
	    this.name = name;
	  }
	  
	  public void greet(){
	    System.out.println("Hello " + this.name);
	  }
}
```
We can then create a file in the same directory called `Main.java`, and use the class:

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Greeter me = new Greeter("Kieran");
    me.greet(); // Prints "Hello Kieran"
  }
}
```

Java also supports [abstract classes](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_abstract.asp), [class methods](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_class_methods.asp), [private/public](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/public-vs-private-access-modifiers-in-java/) and other OO features.

### Critiques
The primary critiques of object oriented programming lie in the [[Abstraction (TODO)|abstraction]], in particular the hierarchical abstraction presented by inheritance. Because classes can inherit from other classes you can often get unexpected behaviour. Primarily this is because you pull all of the class properties from a previous class, you might pull things you weren't expecting. This problem is amplified as you add more classes in the inheritance chain. For example:
- 
- mutability: Object oriented code is often very mutable, and because objects can often live for a while
- re-used attributes; Reusing an attribute name to mean something different in another context. For example on the `Animal` class the `name` was the species name, but later the class was used to model a dog owned by someone, and the name field was it's given name:

```python
class Animal:
	def __init__(self, name):
		self.name = name

	def get_species(self):
		return self.name

class Dog(Animal):
	def __init__(self, name):
		self.name = name

	def bork(self):
		return "woof"


class Poodle(Dog):
	def __init__(self, name):
		self.name = name

	def prance(self):
		return "I'm prancing"


a = Poodle("Jeremy")

if isinstance(a, Animal):
	print(f"Species is {a.get_species()}") # Print's Species is Jeremy
```
