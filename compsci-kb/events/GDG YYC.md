## Cloud/Devops/ Platform engineering
...

Instead of devops where a request comes in, something is setup and then each group has their own setup you have more of a self-service option that has standardized solutions. 

For example in a typical devops solution a team would request version control management, the devops team spins up and configured GitLab for their request, and if they want to use Jenkins as a CI/CD runner then Jenkins is setup for them ad-hoc. 

In a platform engineering solution a team would fill out a form and pick the standard tool to instantiate (GitLab in this case), then they request to implement Jenkins into GitLab, which then is built out as a **standard solution** which can be used for any and all teams that want them. In this way the platform itself is a self-service product that allows people to pick what they want, then the devops team helps work with clients to build out solutions, then platform engineers will maintain the platform and it's standard services.
