This includes everything from the development of mice, keyboards, touchscreens etc. to design principles and policies for accessibility. In a modern context HCI is used to refer to more research-oriented topics and research groups, where once something becomes practical people tend to consider it more in the domain of design, or engineering. But, it‚Äôs important to remember that many of the technologies we take for granted now such as mice, keyboards, touchscreens, and even practices like UX are heavily informed and initially developed under HCI. Even down to something such as the psychological effects of network latency on people‚Äôs opinion of a website would fall under HCI.\nEarly Days ¬ß\nToday we take the name computer for granted. There is a long history that lead to what we call the computer, starting with the work of people like Charles Babbage, and Alan Turing. For a long time their machines, which were big mechanical systems that used punch cards to operate were the dominant force for doing computation. It took more than a century (1833-1940) for Babbage‚Äôs work to become the digital systems we know and love.\nEarly computers were massive and complex to operate in comparison to today1. The ENIAC (The Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) was the first fully digital (electric), general purpose computer2, and using it was not easy. You would use a combination of cables and plugs to connect the electrical signals across the machine. IT could then output the results to a set of punch cards. In general there was about 6 people ever who actually were able to program on the machine effectively. The 6 women3 spent days and days re-organizing plugs and cables to match the specifications of each individual program, and when a new program needed to be run, that work would all need to be re-done4. Even with all of this people realized that running mechanical machines was just much slower than running digital electric signals.\nKeyboards came about as a natural extension of the typewriters at the time. They were even used (depending on how you define it) for the ENIAC5. Various methods were used such as punch cards, a long paper-tape system that would go into the machine as you typed, and various other attempts. Many teletype machines (typewriters with a simple form of electrical networking) could be used to send messages over a distance. These eventually developed into computer terminals. In the 1950‚Äôs Douglas Engelbart developed patents for both GUI (graphical user interfaces), and the mouse.\nGUI is what we use every day, it‚Äôs what you‚Äôre currently using to view this document. It‚Äôs the idea that you want graphics to display an application, that is not just plain text (TUI or terminal/text user interface). This is the basis of essentially all modern applications, and with it the mouse is an important input device to make using GUI‚Äôs simple.\nResources ¬ß\n\nDouglas Engelbart\n\nDouglas Engelbart | Inventor of the Computer Mouse | Britannica\nThe computer mouse and interactive computing - SRI\n\n\nKeyboards\n\nWho Invented Keyboard - Javatpoint\nThe History of the Computer Keyboard (thoughtco.com)\n\n\nOld computers\n\nENIAC at Penn Engineering (upenn.edu)\nENIAC: The First Computer (youtube.com)\nComputer History: 1946 ENIAC Computer History Remastered FULL VERSION First Electronic Computer U.S. (youtube.com)\nThe Binac, 1949 (computerhistory.org)\nUNIVAC, the first commercially produced digital computer in the U.S, is dedicated | June 14, 1951 | HISTORY\nEDSAC - Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator ‚Äî The National Museum of Computing (tnmoc.org)\n\n\nModern HCI research\n\nRyo Suzuki | Interactions Lab - University of Calgary HCI Group (ucalgary.ca)\nResearch ‚Äî MIT Media Lab\nPublications - Meta Research (facebook.com)\nHuman-Computer Interaction and Visualization ‚Äì Google Research\nUCLA HCI\nUCLA Connection Lab ‚Äî We are shaping the future of human interaction.\n\n\n\nFootnotes ¬ß\n\n\nComputer History: All About the ENIAC - HP Store Canada ‚Ü©\n\n\nThe world‚Äôs first general purpose computer turns 75 | Penn Today (upenn.edu) ‚Ü©\n\n\nhttps://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=3951187&amp;page=1&amp;singlePage=true#:~:text=So%2C%20too%2C%20were%20the%20historians%2C%20who%20for%20a%20half%20century%20never%20acknowledged%20the%20wartime%20contributions%20of%20the%20six%20women%20who%20programmed%20the%20Electronic%20Numerical%20Integrator%20and%20Computer%20(ENIAC)%20and%20made%20programming%20easier%20and%20more%20accessible%20to%20those%20who%20followed. ‚Ü©\n\n\nENIAC | History, Computer, Stands For, Machine, &amp; Facts | Britannica ‚Ü©\n\n\nRe: who made the first computer keyboard?

It‚Äôs the system that governs how your computer talks to servers around the world to retrieve webpages, talk to your online calendar, and even send messages in point of sales systems. It basically gives you a set of rules to follow and a way for computers to talk to one another. It runs on top of existing networking hardware connections and is often something you can directly access as part of web development frameworks.\nFormat ¬ß\nHTTP is a request-response system. This means there is one computer (the client) that sends a request to another computer (the host), which then generates and sends a response. An easy analogy would be to think of sending mail. Someone sends a letter, it gets delivered, and then someone sends a response.\nURL‚Äôs/URI‚Äôs ¬ß\nThe first thing you need in order to be able to send a request is somewhere to send it to. URL‚Äôs are used in the browser to indicate where you want to go on the web, and what pages you want to access. For example this page has a URL of https://schulichignite.com/definitions/http. This follows a format of: protocol://domain_name/slug. So in this URL https is the protocol, schulichignite.com is the domain name, and /definitions/http is the slug.\nProtocols ¬ß\nHttp is a protocol. This basically tells the browser how it should format it‚Äôs communications. HTTP is the one used on most of the internet (or https), but there‚Äôs also FTP, SMTP, file and other protocols that can be used.\nDomains ¬ß\nA domain is something you purchase from a domain name registrar. The only way to communicate between two computers is an IP address, something like 192.168.1.1. The problem is that these suck to use, so domains allow you (with the help of DNS) to register a domain name and map it to an IP address.\nSo if we were to buy schulichignite.com, and then register a DNS record of @ A 192.168.1.1 then @ means this domain, an A record means map an IP address, and 192.168.1.1 is our hypothetical server. So when someone goes to http://schulichignite.com it would be the same as going to http://192.168.1.1, and they would get our server!\nSlugs ¬ß\nSlugs are used to identify different resources when you get to a server. Leaving a URL at the ‚Äúhome/root URL‚Äù (i.e. http://schulichignite.com) sets the slug to /. From there this means you can have a bunch of webpages that your server can serve to a user based on what slug they provide. So for example https://schulichignite.com/scorch gives us a slug of /scorch. So first the https://schulichignite.com tells our browser to lookup the server for schulichignite.com (let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs IP is 192.168.1.1), then communicates to it over HTTP and asks for the /scorch page!\nHeaders ¬ß\nHeaders are key-value pairs that are used to communicate information between the client and host. This is essentially extra data used to inform one another about settings, preferences, security standards etc. Headers are in key-value format, so for example to indicate the date you might do:\nDate: Wed, 10 May 2023 20:34:20GMT\nHeaders can include whatever information you want, but there are many standards that are existing and respected by many http servers, so be careful if you are making your own up that they aren‚Äôt taken already!\nMIME Types ¬ß\nWhen we work on our computer we often use extensions to tell what type a file is. This doesn‚Äôt work in networking. Instead we use MIME types to indicate what type of resource something is. This is what changes how your browser processes a page so it can tell when it should treat a URL as a PDF vs a HTML page vs an image etc. A MIME type is just a header (typically called content-type), and there is a list of approved MIME types recognized by the browser.\nContent ¬ß\nContent is just the plain text associated with the resource you are looking to access. If it‚Äôs a webpage then it‚Äôs the HTML/CSS/JS source code, if it‚Äôs an image it‚Äôs the raw binary data etc.\nProcess ¬ß\nwhen looking at HTTP communication there is the host and the client. The host is the system that receives a request and has the resource that is being requested by the client. The steps for HTTP communication are:\n\nClient sends an HTTP request with the info of the Host they want to contact, and the slug/uri\nHost parses the HTTP request, and processes it as needed to find the resource user wants\nHost generates and HTTP response and sends it back to client\n\nflowchart TD\n    a[Client] --1. REQUEST: GET me /web on schulichignite.com --&gt; b[Host]\n    b --3. RESPONSE: HTML file for the page schulichignite.com/web --&gt; a\n    b--2. finds requested resource associated with /web on server--&gt;b\n\nRequest ¬ß\nThese are used to request CRUD (Create, read, update delete) operations from a server. Keep in mind that in order to send a request to a server you need the IP address, and you need to allow a port on the host computer to be open. A port is what allows you to specify where on the host machine you want to access. This means one computer can run multiple servers by running them on different ports. Most commonly you will use port 80 for http, and 443 for https.\nRequest Methods ¬ß\nThere are various things you can request from a server, at the start of an HTTP request you need to specify what method you want to request with. This will determine how the server interprets what you want to do such as:\n\nGetting a webpage\nPosting the data from a form you filled out\nPutting a new image on your instagram page\nRequesting to delete something from your account\n\nOnce sent they will await for a response\nHTTP has a ton of request methods for telling the server what you want to do, here are a few:\n\nGET: give me the resource at the slug I requested (used to get pages)\nPOST: Take the data I‚Äôm giving you and process it (used to post some information to the server)\nPUT: Take the data I‚Äôm giving you and create a new resource on the server (put this image I‚Äôm posting on my account)\nDELETE: Delete the resource I‚Äôm requesting\n\nParameters ¬ß\nParameters are one of the three ways to send data to a server (the headers and/or the body are the other two). Parameters are two standards used to pass information to a server via the request URL.\nQuery Parameters ¬ß\nWith query parameters Values are included after the url with ? and key-value pairs for example:\nweather.com/today?city=calgary\n\nMultiple parameters\nweather.com/today?city=calgary&amp;measurements=celcius\n\nPath Parameters ¬ß\nValues that are included in the main URL. So for example weather.com/calgary the API will define\nweather.com/{city} The /calgary is a variable called city\n\nMultiple Parameters\nweather.com/{city}/{measurement}\nweather.com/calgary/celcius\n\nI used {} here to indicate a variable, but some systems use &lt;&gt;, like /&lt;city&gt;\nParameter security ¬ß\nWhen you put things in a URL they are visible, don‚Äôt put private info there!\nPath parameters:\nweather.com/login/{username}/{password}\nweather.com/login/john/P455W0RD\n\nQuery Parameters:\nweather.com/login?password=P455W0RD&amp;username=john\n\nNow someone only has to look at the user‚Äôs browser history to steal the password for the user account!\nRequest Example ¬ß\nRequests are just plain text, the format is as follows:\nMETHOD /slug HTTP/version\nheader: value\n \ncontent\nSo when making a GET request to http://schulichignite.com/scorch via HTTP 1.1 you would send (no content because GET requests don‚Äôt need content):\nGET /beginner HTTP/1.1\nHost: schulichignite.com\nWhen sending data via a POST request, you also have a body, here‚Äôs an example of a form submission on example.com/form :\nPOST /form HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nContent-Length: &lt;needs to be calculated&gt;\n \nname=kieran&amp;age=24\n*The Content-Type header indicates a MIME type\nWhen sending data via a POST request, you also have a body, here‚Äôs an example of a JSON body on weather.com/calgary :\nPOST /calgary HTTP/1.1\nHost: weather.com\nContent-Type: application/json\nContent-Length: &lt;needs to be calculated&gt;\n \n{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;11/29/2022&quot;}\n*The Content-Type header indicates a MIME type\nResponse ¬ß\nOnce a request is received the server will generate a response, this response looks similar to a request but with some different fields.\nSome additional documentation can be found here\nAnnoyingly basically every header in an HTTP response is optional, except status codes.\nResponse/status Codes ¬ß\nStatus codes are how a host tells a client how processing their request went. This is the only required header in a response. There are a lot of them, but here‚Äôs the basics:\n\n100-199: Give me some info\n200-299: All good\n300-399: Hold up, gotta do something first\n400-499: Client error\n500-599: Host Error\n\n*Typically they will also have a message associated, eg: 404 Not Found\nResponse Example ¬ß\nResponses are also just plain text, the format is as follows:\nstatus_code message\nheader: value\n \ncontent\nHere is an example of a simple html page response:\n200 OK\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nServer: cloudflare\nDate: Tue, 29 Nov 2022 20:34:20 GMT\n \n&lt;!doctype html&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\nError codes will often have no content, they may be as simple as:\n404 Not Found\nOr if there‚Äôs an error page they might have a ‚Äúfull‚Äù response:\n404 NOT FOUND\nDate: Tue, 29 Nov 2022 20:34:20 GMT\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nServer: cloudflare\n \n&lt;!doctype html&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Oops...

This I think is the best way to talk about linux &amp; unix since often the history informs the technical decisions.\n\nUNIX was an operating system developed at bell labs. UNIX was an incredibly popular operating system especially for academics when it was released. UNIX was primarily closed source, meaning it‚Äôs code was proprietary. It was a system that had tons of tools that were built to internally suit the needs of bell labs. These tools are often still used today (like grep, awk, cat etc.), or something inspired from them.\nLinux on the other hand was open source and is a combination of a few pieces of software all rolled up into one package. Linux as we know it today is a combination of:\n\nGNU tools (gcc etc.)\nLinus Torvalds‚Äô Kernel (called linux)\n\nPeople who are a part of the free software movement will often call it GNU + Linux instead of just Linux.

This is a shortform for any unix-like operating system, like linux\n\nLinux vs UNIX ¬ß\nWhat are the actual differences between them, and why are they mentioned together? The main reason you see the two mentioned together is because the philosophies that guided the development of UNIX were a large influence on Linux. Both follow the POSIX standards for how to implement operating systems. Many early Linux users were UNIX users who wanted to find a free software alternative to UNIX. At the time UNIX was relatively expensive, and so for individuals an open source alternative was appealing. Besides that they each use separate kernels, and internal tools to build out the specifics of each operating system.\nDistros ¬ß\nA distro follows the traditional format of the underlying operating system, but typically with more specific changes. For example [linux mint](https://linuxmint.com/, Zorin OS, and ubuntu are all linux debian-systems, but they have quite significant differences as far as user experience goes. I mentioned debian in the last sentence, what is debian?\nWell for distros there are lots of ‚Äúbase‚Äù of distros, where the distros will follow the design philosophies of a broader system. For example someone might say they use a debian based system (like we talked about before), or they may say they prefer to use arch-based, or maybe fedora based. What this means is that the distro implements the features of debian, arch or fedora, then adds on top of it. Which one your distro is based on will change what files you can install, the user interfaces you can use, and the philosophies behind the more ‚Äúsubjective‚Äù parts of the POSIX standard. Debian-based systems for example can install .deb programs, whereas fedora-based would instead be able to install .rpm programs.\nAdditional Resources ¬ß\n\nTechnical information\n\nUnix Pipeline (Brian Kernighan) - Computerphile (youtube.com)\nFile systems\n\nUNIX Inodes and Files (Harry) (youtube.com)\nWhat‚Äôs behind a file descriptor in Linux?

These are common on linux systems, but less common on windows. They give advantages over just normally just installing applications because you can manage versions, updates, and uninstalling more easliy:\n\n\napt, dpkg, git, Python PiP (Linux Package Management) // Linux for Hackers // EP 5 - YouTube\n\n\nThe APT Package Manager in Debian and Ubuntu - YouTube\n\n\nWindows Package Manager | Microsoft Docs\n\n\nThe Missing Package Manager for macOS (or Linux) ‚Äî Homebrew\n\n\nChocolatey Software | Chocolatey - The package manager for Windows\n\n\nThere is an alternative to package managers that are essentially containerized forms of package managers:\n\n\nSnapcraft - Snaps are universal Linux packages\n\n\nFlatpak‚Äîthe future of application distribution\n\n\nDistro‚Äôs ¬ß\nDistro‚Äôs or distributions is the name given to different ‚Äúflavours‚Äù of operating systems (really only applies to linux since there‚Äôs 1 version of macos and 1 version of windows). A distro is what you actually install to your computer and includes a kernel, and all the default userspace packages and configurations.\nThere are many different distro‚Äôs, but generally there are some groups of ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù ones that do thing in a similar way and have similar setups. Packages can have a wide range of formats and which ones are supported is often tied to the type of distro you use\nDebian ¬ß\nThe most popular type of linux distro. Can use raw binaries or .deb files for packages. Typically uses apt as a package manager:\n\n\nZorinOS:¬†Zorin OS - Make your computer better.\n\n\nMint:¬†Home - Linux Mint,¬†Linux Mint ¬∑ GitHub\n\n\nUbuntu:¬†Enterprise Open Source and Linux | Ubuntu\n\n\nCutefish:¬†CuteFishOS - A Clean Mac-Like Linux Desktop - YouTube\n\n\nParrot:¬†Parrot Security\n\n\nKali:¬†Kali Linux | Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Linux Distribution\n\n\nPOP!:¬†Pop!_OS by System76\n\n\nElementary:¬†The thoughtful, capable, and ethical replacement for Windows and macOS ‚ãÖ elementary OS\n\n\nArch ¬ß\nConsidered to be the bleeding edge, and also typically the hardest learning curve.

You build your system from nothing and basically create ‚Äúyour own distro‚Äù\n\n\nWelcome to Linux From Scratch!\n\n\nLinux From Scratch - Wikipedia\n\n\nProcesses ¬ß\nA running program. They are essentially enclosed processes that have a bunch of state. When a process is made it will have a PID you can use to identify the process. While each process is seperate you can technically ‚Äúpipe‚Äù the contents of processes between each other, typically using STDIN and STDOUT:\n\n\nLinux Internals - Process Management - YouTube\n\n\nLinux processes, init, fork/exec, ps, kill, fg, bg, jobs - YouTube\n\n\nTerminal/Shell ¬ß\nThe shell is the name given to the system that lets you start and stop processes. The terminal is just the visualization of the shell that you interact with. When you start processes via clicking on a shortcut this still goes through the shell, but you likely won‚Äôt see the terminal representation.\nShells:\n\n\nBash;¬†Bash (Unix shell) - Wikipedia,¬†Bash - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation\n\n\nZSH;¬†Z shell - Wikipedia,¬†Zsh\n\n\nFish:¬†fish shell\n\n\nTerminals\n\n\nOh My Zsh - a delightful &amp; open source framework for Zsh\n\n\nTermux;¬†Termux | Terminal emulator and Linux environment for Android.\n\n\nCmder;¬†cmderdev/cmder: Lovely console emulator package for Windows (github.com)\n\n\nwarp:¬†Warp: The terminal for the 21st century\n\n\nAlacritty:¬†alacritty/alacritty: A cross-platform, OpenGL terminal emulator.

On windows you need to use the gui prompt.\nFile System ¬ß\nThis is the system that is used to keep track of your files. People use this term to refer to multiple things (including both the way things are stored, and the file structure itself), but this just simply refers to the actual process of how your files are stored.\nFurther on we will talk about the file system structures that are common on operating systems, and that is not about how something is stored, but where things are commonly stored (though sometimes people still just call it the file system)\n\n(5) Files &amp; File Systems: Crash Course Computer Science #20 - YouTube\n‚ÄùThe ZFS filesystem‚Äù - Philip Paeps (LCA 2020) (youtube.com)\n\nFile System Structure ¬ß\nThis is the standard used to describe where you should look in a file system for certain things (i.e. installed apps, default configurations etc.)\n\n\nLinux Directories Explained in 100 Seconds - YouTube\n\n\nLinux File System/Structure Explained! - YouTube\n\n\n(5) Linux vs Windows File System Structure Compared! - YouTube\n\n\n[Environment variables](Terminal Basics (kieranwood.ca)) (These often get used to make finding certain paths easier)\n\n\nFile System Formats ¬ß\nThis is the way in which the file system actually stores it‚Äôs data.

This section covers programming more holistically, and will be more difficult than just learning a language to start with.\nProgramming Languages ¬ß\nComputers communicate using electrical signals, these signals are then abstracted into binary. This allows programmers to control these signals in easier to work with ways. Programming languages are built on top of layers and layers of existing firmware and operating systems. Programming languages let you define programs (also called applications or binaries) that run in order to do something. Anything you run on your electronic devices today is the result of a programming language.\nMarkup vs Programming languages ¬ß\nProgramming languages are Turing complete, this is a fancy name for meaning it can be used to do whatever you want. The intention with programming languages is to create programs/apps that do things. Markup languages instead define what should show up. For example the language that is used in PDF‚Äôs or on webpages are markup languages. They don‚Äôt actually do any processing, instead it tells the computer where to draw things on the screen that you want to show the user.\nSource Code, Binaries, and scripts ¬ß\nSource code are the actual files a programmer works with to create binaries. Binaries (not to be confused with binary) are software that can be run by a computer. The source code is essentially an easily readable set of instructions, which the computer then compiles (using a compiler) into ‚Äúmachine code‚Äù, which is what the computer then actually runs. Binaries are also called:\n\napplications, or apps\nscripts\nexecutables or execs\n\nPseudocode ¬ß\nFor this section I will use Pseudocode, this is a fancy name for ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to write real code‚Äù. Essentially it will be a mix of code syntax and plain English to make it easy to read. It also lets me explain topics and syntax from multiple language at once.\nCompiled vs interpreted ¬ß\nThere are various different types of languages. Compiled languages (like go, C, Rust, etc.) require you to compile your code.  This process takes a few steps usually, and results in a binary that is pure machine code. This means once it‚Äôs compiled any  similarly configured system can just run the binary. This means the flow of your development is:\n\nWrite source code\ncompile\nRun the resulting binary\n\nTypically compiled languages have the tradeoff of taking longer to be able to initially run your code, however they are typically also more optimized than the other option, which is interpreted languages. Interpreted languages (Java, python etc) instead allow you to compile your code into an intermediate language (or Bytecode. From there if people have the language installed they can execute the intermediate language. This is usually faster than compiling to machine code because the language doesn‚Äôt care about having to make sure everything necessary to run is included. Instead it just includes what is necessary for people to run who have the language installed already.\nSo for example if you write a go program and compile it for windows you can send the resulting executable to someone on windows running the same architecture, and it will work. If you instead write in Java then the result you send them can only be run in java, or you have to include the entire java runtime for them to be able to run it.\nPython takes this a step further where to run python code you actually can‚Äôt compile it at all, to run python code you have to use the python binary, and it will then do the Bytecode and machine code conversions on the fly for you when you run the program.\nRuntime/environment ¬ß\nYour runtime/environment is the actual language that runs your code. For languages that compile to machine code there isn‚Äôt really an environment after compiling. For languages that run in a REPL or use Bytecode a runtime is what actually executes the code you type in.\nREPL ¬ß\nREPL (Read, Eval, Print, Loop) is a special way to execute code.  It is mostly used for testing, but it is possible to run full programs using it. REPL works by running your code line-by-line as you type them. For example each &gt;&gt;&gt; would be a statement, and underneath is the printed result:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 4\n4\n&gt;&gt;&gt; x + 10\n14\n&gt;&gt;&gt; x += 4\n8\n\nSo as you can see the language Reads your code, Evaluates it, Prints the relevant result, Loops to wait for the next input. This method is also available for some compiled languages, though typically through third party libraries (i.e. gore for go).\nTranspiling &amp; Code Generation ¬ß\nA transpiler is a program that takes in code of one type and converts it to some other type of code. Sometimes the word is also used for transpiling markup languages. Essentially we want to take some text and convert it to text that is useful for us. A transpiller specifically tends to do this using the same methods that Compilers (TODO) use.\nCode generation is instead a method of creating code based on some input. For example ezcv is a program that takes in information about you and generates HTML/CSS/Javascript for it. Essentially because source code is just text, we just need some code to produce text for us. For example here is a code generator that takes in your name and would generate a python file to print it:\nname = input(&quot;Type your name&quot;)\n\nwrite_file(content=&quot;print({name})&quot;, filename=&quot;print_name.py&quot;)\n\nThis takes in your name from some sort of input, then writes a file called print_name.py with the source code print(name).\nBytecode ¬ß\nBytecode is a low-level, platform-independent representation of a program‚Äôs source code that has been translated from a high-level programming language. Instead of being directly executable by a computer‚Äôs hardware, bytecode serves as an intermediate step. You generate bytecode from source code and then the language runtime will actually run the code. It is typically generated by a compiler or an interpreter and consists of compact, binary instructions that are designed to be efficiently interpreted by a virtual machine specific to the programming language.\nBytecode in theory allows for greater portability of software, as it can be executed on any system equipped with the appropriate virtual machine, providing a level of abstraction between the application and the underlying hardware architecture. For example let‚Äôs say we have the code:\nprint(&quot;hello&quot;)\n\nThis code is easy to read and friendly, but if we were to put this code in python and get it‚Äôs resulting bytecode (using dis), it looks like this:\n1         0 RESUME                   0\n \n2         2 LOAD_GLOBAL              1 (NULL + print)\n\t\t 14 LOAD_FAST                0 (text)\n\t\t 16 PRECALL                  1\n\t\t 20 CALL                     1\n\t\t 30 POP_TOP\n\t\t 32 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)\n\t\t 34 RETURN_VALUE\nThis bytecode could be taken and run anywhere that supports python (though usually you just run python from it‚Äôs source code, and don‚Äôt even see this step). This code would then be transpilled into the machine code for your system. This can be handy for interoperability, and for optimizations that are cross-platform.\nNode-based ¬ß\nThere is one other paradigm of languages that is newer that exists. Node-based languages are languages that use nodes to visually connect your data processing. Under the hood these are fancy transpillers, whatever you create visually will generate some code, and then it will be processed however that language works. These nodes will each typically represent 1 function, and then will have ways of passing information between them. For example imagine a program where a function gets someone‚Äôs name and birthdate, then sends that into another function which shows ‚Äúhappy birthday‚Äù if it‚Äôs their birthday. The pseudocode might be:\ninfo = get_user_info() // Returns some info\n\nif info.birthday == Today:\n\tsay_happy_birthday()\n\nIn a node-based language it might look something like this:\n\nFor example:\n\nNode-RED\nscratch\nmake code\ndark lang\nTorq\nPower Automate\nTines\n\nComments ¬ß\nComments are what they sound like, they don‚Äôt do anything and they‚Äôre there to let you add comments for yourself and other developers to read. This can be handy (especially when starting) to provide information that is not easily ascertainable by the code. A comment can be on it‚Äôs own line, or ‚Äúinline‚Äù. inline comments will go after some code. Comments can also be single-line, or multiline. In the example below the comment character will be //, which means anything after // will be a comment. For example:\n// This is a signle line comment\n\nsome_code // This is an inline comment\n\nHowever there are various different comment characters that are used for example:\n# This is jused in python, bash, YAML etc.\n// This is used in C, Rust, Javascript etc.\n-- This is used in SQL, Haskell etc.\n&lt;!-- This is used in HTML, XML etc. --&gt;\n; This is a comment in assembly, etc.\n! This is a comment in FORTRAN, etc.\n% This is a single line comment in Erlang, LaTeX, etc.\n\nAnd multiline comments can be different:\n&quot;&quot;&quot;This is a multiline comment in\n\t- python\n&quot;&quot;&quot;\n/* This is a multine comment in\n\t- C\n\t- Rust\n\t- Javascript\n\t- CSS\n\t- etc.\n*/\n{-- This is a multiline comment in\n\t- Haskell\n--}\n\n\nFor my pseudocode I will use // for comments and /* */ for multiline comments.\nVariables ¬ß\nWhen working with code you will inevitably want to store some information. To store information we use variables. Variables are basically labels we can use to refer to information more easily. Different languages have different rules about how to create variables, and how to use them, but every language has variables in some form.\nAssignment and initialization ¬ß\nWhen you want to use a variable you need to create it. The simplest form of this in many programming languages is to put the label (variable name) on the left, and then an = and then the value. For example:\nname = kieran\n\nYou  can then typically reference this later in the file using the label. For example here might be some math:\nx = 4\ny = 3\n\nz = x + y // z is 7\n\nMutability ¬ß\nMutability is the concept that you can change variables. Some types of data you store are able to be mutated so that their content can be changed, others cannot. If a variable cannot be changed it is called an immutable variable. For example here is a mutable variable:\nx = 4\n\nx = 5\n\nIn some languages (like rust) values are immutable by default and you have to specify mutable values.\nmut x = 5 // x can be mutated\n\ny = 5 // y is immutable\n\nConstants and immutable values ¬ß\nConstants exist in some languages, constants cannot be updated regardless of the type used. These are good for things that don‚Äôt change (like the value of PI, or the gravitational constant). Most languages your variables are mutable. In these languages you can sometimes specify variables as immutable with constants, or other language constructs like readonly:\nreadonly x = 5\n\nconst PI = 3.14159\n\nScoping ¬ß\nVariables don‚Äôt exist forever. If they did then long running programs would be very inefficient. What programming languages do instead is they scope variables, so they get deleted when they‚Äôre no longer needed. The scoping rules, and how they apply differ by language.\nThis also helps to avoid some common issues that might come up with variables. For example lets say you have some code that uses the variable name then later you have some code that also uses name. In this case whichever one comes last would override the other. However if they are in different scopes, then they can be used independent of one another. Often for example you can have a program where name is used in one file, and name is used in another file, but since the variables are scoped to each file they don‚Äôt conflict. For example:\nfile1.name // Kieran\n\nfile2.name // Jamie\n\nIn this case code in file1 will get Kieran when they use name and file2 would get Jamie when they use name. Scoping is also heavily tied to Conditionals , and Functions.\nData Types ¬ß\nNot all data is formatted the same. Data types are the basic building blocks that let you define what data looks like. It gives information about what you‚Äôre trying to store and effects performance, and what information you can put in a variable\nDynamic vs Strict Typing ¬ß\nDynamic languages will allow you to create variables without stating a data type explicitly, instead they are inferred, for example:\nx = 4\ny = 3\n\nz = x + y // z is 7\n\nIn this case the type of the data is inferred meaning when x is assigned to 4 it‚Äôs inferred to be an Integer. In other languages you have to explicitly state the data type. If you have to state the type it‚Äôs referred to as static typed, whereas ones without needing to specify the type are called dynamic typed (or duck typed sometimes). For static languages, this is an example of how you define a variable:\n// type label = value\nint x = 4 // Rust, C and other languages use this format\n\n// label:type = value\nx:int = 4 // Typescript and others use this format\n\nSome languages can let you specify when you want to infer vs be strict. For example in go := means assign a variable and infer it‚Äôs type:\n// Explicit typing\nint x = 4\n\n// Inferred tpye\nx:= 4\n\nSome languages will also allow you to declare a variable without a value, which can be initialized with a value later. For example:\nint x\n\nx = 4\n\nPrimitive vs Derived types ¬ß\nPrimitive types are data types that are included by default in most languages. They are the essential data types used to build programs. Every type we cover in this section will be a primitive type. A derived type is a type that is programmer created and not part of the language. You can create these using classes/structs/enums.\nInteger ¬ß\nIntegers are normal whole numbers (no decimals). So for example here are some integers:\nx = 5\ny = 32\nz = -256\nq = 0\n\nIn many languages you will find integers being referred to as int.\nSizing ¬ß\nIntegers are often split up by sizes. This can help massively with optimization, but can make things more complicated. In languages that specify them usually there will be an i with a number. This number will typically indicate the bits:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbolDescriptionMin and Maxi88 bit integer (1 byte)-128 to 127i1616 bit integer-32,768 to 32,767i3232 bit integer-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647In some languages they instead have short, long, long long and other shorthands for integers. You would need to lookup the specifics in each language to find these, but typically they will correspond to a number that has a certain number of bits.\nSigned vs Unsigned ¬ß\nAn unsigned integer is an integer that can only be positive. A signed integer is an integer that can be  positive or negative. In many programming languages you will see an unsigned integer as starting with U:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbolDescriptionMin and Maxu88 bit integer (1 byte)0 to 255u1616 bit integer0 to 65,535u3232 bit integer0 to 4,294,967,295As you can see compared to the signed integers above, unsigned integers can hold larger numbers for the same number of bits.\nFloat/Floating Point ¬ß\nFloats (floating point numbers) are decimal numbers. This includes positive¬†and¬†negative numbers. One important thing to keep in mind while working with floats is that every language has a limited precision (whole site dedicated to this). This means it will only be accurate to a certain number of digits. There are also common rounding errors, like the famous 0.1+0.2 == 0.30000000000000004.\nCollections ¬ß\nCollections are a data type that is used to hold multiple other data types. For example lets say you wanted to keep track of all of the names of items in a player inventory. You could put them into a collection to keep track of all of them in one variable, instead of a separate variable for each item! There are tons of different types of collections, some of the names are not always exactly the same across languages, so keep that in mind when looking at this info!\nLists ¬ß\nLists are a dynamic collection. They basically let you add as much (besides memory constraints) data as you want. In strongly typed languages (ones where you have to specify types), they can only have 1 data type, in most other languages they can take whatever data you want. Here is an example of what it might look like in a¬†non-strongly typed language:\nages = [18,21,18,19,20]\nThis gives you a list where\n\nYou can then access the element using it‚Äôs¬†index. The index is essentially the number that indicates where in the list a value is (starting from 0). You can access this using¬†ages[index]. So if you wanted to access the¬†second¬†element you could use¬†ages[1]¬†(which in this case would be 21):\n\nTraditionally lists will have methods to add, remove, and pop. Add and remove are self explanatory, but pop is probably a new idea. Pop will run and it will  delete an item from the front of a list and then return that value.\nArrays ¬ß\nArrays are one of the most basic collection types. These are typically quite restrictive, but very fast. You will have to specify the length of an array as well as the types it will contain.\nSo for example if you want to store the ages of 5 people as integers you might do something like this:\nages[5]&lt;Int&gt; = [18,21,18,19,20]\n\nThis gives you an array where:\n\nYou can then access the element using it‚Äôs¬†index. The index is essentially the number that indicates where in the list a value is (starting from 0). You can access this using¬†ages[index]. So if you wanted to access the¬†second¬†element you could use¬†ages[1]¬†(which in this case would be 21):\n\nThis data type can be different in different languages, Arrays in JavaScript are actually Lists for example.\nSets ¬ß\nSets are collections that require¬†unique¬†items. This is implemented different ways in different languages, but for example:\nwords = set(&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;oranges&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;great&quot;)\nprint(words) // [&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;oranges&quot;, &quot;great&quot;]\n\nEven though ‚Äúhello‚Äù was given twice it only appears once. This makes sets great for checking if something exists. Imagine you are searching through a book, and want to check if the book has the word ‚Äúdisparate‚Äù in it. Now lets say there are 900 times the word ‚Äúthe‚Äù appears. To search all the words you have to search through all 900 repeats of ‚Äúthe‚Äù, but with a set there‚Äôs only 1 occurrence of ‚Äúthe‚Äù.\nTuple‚Äôs ¬ß\nTuples are similar to lists, except once the values have been added they can‚Äôt be changed (it‚Äôs immutable). So you can‚Äôt add items to a tuple, it‚Äôs stuck how it is. This can be handy for data you don‚Äôt want to let be modified. For example someone‚Äôs birthday:\nbirthday = (&#039;oct&#039;, 29, 1998) \nbirthday[2] += 1 # ERROR\n\nYou don‚Äôt want to accidentally have someone add something to the birthday because the data doesn‚Äôt change! This is often used in databases since the data being returned should be considered read-only, and copied into something mutable if people want to make changes.\nAssociative Arrays/Maps/JSON/Dictionaries ¬ß\nThese are the first collection that does not use indexes for it‚Äôs elements. All of these are different names for what are called key-value stores. Instead of using indexes you can set your own ‚Äòkey‚Äô, which maps to a value. This lets you represent abstract data with it‚Äôs own labels easily. For example information about a user:\nuser = {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Kieran&quot;, &quot;age&quot;:24, &quot;developer&quot;:true} \n\nuser[&quot;name&quot;] # &quot;Kieran&quot;\n\nUnder the hood this uses Hashing to be more efficient. Additionally a blog post about creating these data structures from scratch can be found here.\nText types ¬ß\nThere are several ways to represent text in most programming languages based on what you need.\nChar ¬ß\nA char is a single character. In many languages this type is actually an integer under the hood. There will be a list where each character has a number corresponding to it and you can convert back and forth between them. For example in python you can see this text-number conversion with the¬†ord()¬†and¬†chr()¬†functions:\nord(&quot;a&quot;) # 97 chr(97) # &#039;a&#039;\nOther languages like C you can just convert characters to integers and back natively:\nchar a = &#039;a&#039;;\n \nint numericalA = (int)a; // Returns ASCII value of &#039;a&#039;\nIn some languages Char‚Äôs and String‚Äôs are differentiated with &#039; and &quot;, but in others this is not the case.\nString ¬ß\nStrings are what we think of as normal text. They allow for the storage of text, in some languages this can be text of any length, in others it‚Äôs a fixed-length amount of text. In some languages strings consist of¬†Basics¬†of¬†Char‚Äôs, in other‚Äôs they‚Äôre their own custom type. For example you could consider ‚Äúhello‚Äù to be either of the below:\n[&#039;H&#039;,&#039;e&#039;,&#039;l&#039;,&#039;l&#039;,&#039;o&#039;]\n\n&quot;Hello&quot;\n\nWhichever you choose in many languages they‚Äôre still treated as an array-like data type. This allows you do loop over characters to do processing.\nWhitespace Characters ¬ß\nIn strings there are often times where you need to include some sort of whitespace. For example this might be inserting a newline character in order to simulate pressing the enter key in most text editors (\\n), or a character to indicate the same effect as pressing tab (\\t). These are called whitespace characters. They tend to be pretty universal.\nFor example:\n greeting = &quot;Hello there!\\nMy name is Kieran. Here are my favourite hobbies\\n\\t- Skiing\\n\\t- Coding&quot;\n\nThis would result in:\nHello there!\nMy name is Kieran. Here are my favourite hobbies\n\t- Skiing    \n\t- Coding\nFormatting ¬ß\nWith strings in most languages there are various ways of doing formatting. Formatting allows you to inject data into strings. This is incredibly powerful, but can also be very dangerous.\nFor example let‚Äôs say you want to have a template email where the variables for recipient (person receiving email) and sender. In python you can put an¬†f¬†in front of a string to turn it into a ‚Äúformat string‚Äù, from there you put the variables inside squiggly braces ({}), and they will be replaced by the values:\nsender = &quot;Kieran&quot; \nrecipient = &quot;you&quot; \n \nemail = f&quot;&quot;&quot;Hello {recipient},\n \nWe appreciate you reaching out, we are not open on the weekend and will re-open on monday at 9am to address your email. \n \nThanks,\n{sender}&quot;&quot;&quot;\nThe same can be done in javascript with strings that use a backtick (`), then stating which should be replaced by variables using squigly braces that have a¬†$¬†in front:\nsender = &quot;Kieran&quot; \nrecipient = &quot;you&quot; \n \nemail = `Hello ${recipient}, \n \nWe appreciate you reaching out, we are not open on the weekend and will re-open on monday at 9am to address your email. \n \nThanks,\n${sender}`\nEncoding ¬ß\nText under the hood is represented as numbers for each character, there are then different sets of numbers that allow for different sets of characters. These are called the encodings. Different systems use different encodings in order to allow different characters.\nFor example ASCII is a very simple encoding that allows 127 different characters. In ASCII ‚Äòa‚Äô would be 97. Unicode is a set of different encodings that allow for a lot more characters. UTF-8 allows 1,112,064 characters, in our example case ‚Äòa‚Äô would still be 97, but this is not the case in every encoding. Also because UTF-8 supports more characters you have to be careful with conversions. Japanese characters work in UTF-8 for example, but¬†not¬†ASCII.\nWe have a page dedicated to encodings here.\nBooleans ¬ß\nBooleans are values that indicate if something is true or false. These can be used in conjunction with Conditionals to tell a program what to do.\nA trivial example would be the current season:\nis_summer = False\nis_winter = False\nis_fall = False\nis_spring = True\n\nBased on this the program might use a conditional to show a certain theme based on the current season. This can also be used for things like user settings:\ndark_theme = true\n\nIn some languages (like C &amp; python) booleans are actually just integers. For example here are the various representations of true and false in different languages:\n// True\ntrue\nYes\n1\nTRUE\nTrue\n\n// False\nfalse\nNo\n0\nFALSE\nFalse\n\nBoolean Logic ¬ß\nLogical operators can be used to make a series of statements and only let them be true based on which operator is used. Traditionally this uses Booleans, which can also take the form of an Integer in languages like C and python. Here are the Boolean logic operators:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameWhat it meansCodeSymbolsANDIf both values are true, the result is true, otherwise Falsetrue &amp;&amp; true // Truetrue &amp;&amp; false // Falsefalse &amp;&amp; true // Falsefalse &amp;&amp; false // False&amp;&amp;, and, ANDORIf one value is true, the result is true, otherwise falsetrue || true // Truetrue || false // Truefalse || true // Truefalse || false // False||, or, ORNOTInvert the operation (true is false and false is true)!true // False!false // True!, NOT, not,XORIf the values are opposite then true, else false, this is a [[Binary, Hexadecimal and Number Systemsbinary/bitwise]] operation meaning it‚Äôs based on 0‚Äôs and 1‚Äôs in binaryTrue ^ True // FalseTrue ^ False // TrueFalse ^ False // False\nThis sort of logic is fundamental for binary operations, Logic Gates (TODO) and much more.\nComparison Operators ¬ß\nComparison operators return a boolean value after comparing two values to see if a statement is True or False\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameDescriptionPythonJSGreaterChecks if something is greater than something else1 &lt; 3 # True1 &lt; 3lessChecks if something is less than something else3 &gt; 1 # True3 &gt; 1 // trueGreater than or equal toChecks if something is greater than or equal tp something else1 &lt;= 3 # True1 &lt;= 3Less than or equal toChecks if something is Less than or equal tp something else3 =&gt; 1 # True3 =&gt; 1\nTruthyness ¬ß\nIn many languages you can do checks against values of other data types to see how ‚Äútruthy‚Äù they are. This is usually done to indicate if a value is ‚Äúempty‚Äù or not. For example:\n&quot;&quot; // Would be false because it&#039;s an empty string\n0  // Would be false because it&#039;s 0\n[] // Would be false because it&#039;s empty\n\nReferential ¬ß\nA referential check is done to see if a variable is exactly the same object as another variable. So not just that the value is the same, but that the two variables are actually talking about¬†the exact same¬†spot in memory. In this case we will use is as the keyword for a referential check:\na = [1,2,3]\nb = a\nc = [1,2,3] \n\na == b // True\nb == c // True\na == c // True \n\na is b // True\nb is c // False\n\nValue and Type ¬ß\nIn some languages when you are checking a value the value itself will be derived from different types. For example :\n1 == True // True\n0 == False // True\n\nIn this case True gets converted to an integer (1) in this case, which we then check for equality and the equality is now true. Sometimes with some languages this goes further like:\n&quot;1&quot; == 1 // True\n\nIn some languages we have an option to equality check while forcing a specific type to be checked. We do this by adding an extra¬†=¬†to our checks (called a strict comparison):\n\n&quot;1&quot; === 1 // False\n\n\nNull, None &amp; undefined types ¬ß\nMany programming languages have some sort of ‚ÄúNull‚Äù value. These values can be called different things, but they essentially are there to state nothing. This may seem entirely useless at first, after all who would want to reference nothing in their programs? Well, it‚Äôs actually very useful for a few reasons. Typically most people use Null as an initialization state. For example you want to create a variable you intend to use later, but have no value to put in it yet. This can be handy because it means that other programs that might use that variable can just check every so often if the value is still Null as a way to wait for it to become initialized.\nIt‚Äôs also useful to do this for space savings. Unlike other placeholder values most Null‚Äôs take up basically no space (in some languages literally no space). This means you can save all that space in memory until you actually need it.\nPointers ¬ß\nA pointer is a way to specify a variable that ‚Äúpoints‚Äù to another value. This is important for languages that aren‚Äôt memory managed (like C). In languages that allow pointers you can specify an address that a pointer references. Whatever is available at that address can be manipulated as if it was the variable. For example:\na = 5\n\nb = *a\n\nb = b - 3\n\nprint(a) // 2\n\nThis allows you to share state as we can see above where we set b = *a, which is saying that b is a pointer to a and so any changes to b will affect a. This is also used under the hood in all other languages, but many languages (like python) don‚Äôt allow you to directly modify these pointers.\nConditionals ¬ß\nIn programming we don‚Äôt always want to execute the same code. Sometimes we want to execute code based on something. We might want to check if someone has a premium account before allowing them to access a song, or check if they‚Äôre in a certain country etc. Conditionals are the way we do these checks, which allow us to conditionally run code based on some sort of check.\nUnder the hood these checks operate based off Booleans. All of the operations done will evaluate to a True or False value which can be checked against.\nIf/Else/ Elif or Else if ¬ß\nThe main statement used for conditionals is the if statement. This statement is made up of two parts, the condition and the body. The body will only execute if the condition is True. For example the¬†print()¬†will always execute:\nif True{\n\tprint(&quot;True!&quot;)\n}\n\nIn this case¬†print(&quot;True!&quot;)¬†is the condition body it is wrapped in {} to indicate what should run if it‚Äôs True. For example if we nest some statements:\nif premium{\n\tif isAdult{\n\t\tprint(&quot;A premium Adult&quot;)\n\t} else {\n\t\tprint(&quot;Just is premium&quot;)\n\t}\n}\n\nIn this case if premium AND isAdult then we get A premium Adult printed.  You can see that each set of {} corresponds to a different condition, and will only run if that condition is true. This is called a scope. In some languages scopes are instead defined by indentation, like python:\nif premium:\n\tif isAdult:\n\t\tprint(&quot;A premium Adult&quot;)\n\telse:\n\t\tprint(&quot;Just is premium&quot;)\nIn this case each level of indentation is a separate scope. From here you can create¬†control flows, which are statements that allow for multiple¬†branches¬†of code where one branch will activate based on a condition. For example code in python that changes based on the current season:\nisSummer = false\nisWinter = false\nisFall = false\nisSpring = true\n \nif (is_summer){\n    print(&quot;It&#039;s warm&quot;)\n} else if (is_spring){\n    print(&quot;It&#039;s raining&quot;)\n} else if (is_fall){\n    print(&quot;It&#039;s getting colder&quot;)\n}else{ \n    //Assumes isWinter is true\n    print(&quot;It&#039;s snowing!&quot;)\n \n} \n\nSome languages also combine the keywork else if into the abbreviated elif.\nFunctions ¬ß\nFunctions are a way to reuse code efficiently. It allows you to define a set of steps of code that should be run when the function is ‚Äúcalled‚Äù, along with a name.\nUsing existing functions ¬ß\nUsing (or ‚Äúcalling‚Äù) existing functions works the same in¬†most¬†languages. You find whatever the name of the function is, and you type¬†function_name(), some functions take in extra data (called¬†parameters), so you can ‚Äúpass‚Äù the function this data when you call it.\nFor example here is how you print some text to the screen in using a¬†print()¬†function:\nprint(&quot;Hello World&quot;)\n\nIn this case we are using a String parameter to tell the function what to print. However there are many times that our functions take in no values, in these cases the functions effects are called side-effects. For example, let‚Äôs say we have a function to restart a computer called restart():\nrestart()\n\nWe have no parameters to pass in because we just want it to effect something else that exists.\nAnatomy of functions ¬ß\nTo create a function there are several parts you need, all of the parts work to define what the function does, and how it does it. These parts are:\n\nThe definition\nThe body\n\nWithin each part there are several sub-parts to consider as well.\nFunction Definition ¬ß\nThis is where you define the function name (and optionally¬†Parameters). To define a function you will need to use the definition keyword in whatever language you are writing, and you will need to provide a name.\nFor example let‚Äôs say¬†func¬†is the definition keyword. So if we were to define a function that will tell you what the weather is today called¬†todays_weather¬†we could do it like this:\nfunc todays_weather(){\n  // This is where the function body will go\n}    \n\nNaming conventions ¬ß\nLanguages will have different naming conventions. You¬†don‚Äôt have to follow these, but it‚Äôs recommended. In python, rust and some others functions are usually ‚Äúsnake case‚Äù, this means the names are all lowercase, and you separate words with ‚Äú_‚Äù. For example first name might become first_name.\nJavascript, Java and others typically uses camelCase, instead of separating different words you just capitalize the first letter. So for first name it would become firstName. This changes nothing about the code that is run with a function, it‚Äôs just a convention people follow in languages to standardize how code looks.\nParameters ¬ß\nParameters are data you can pass to a function in order to be able to re-use code more effectively. For example you might specify a¬†name¬†parameter that is used to pass the user‚Äôs name to a function. Imagine we have a function called¬†greeting()¬†that takes this name parameter, it might look like this in python:\ndef greeting(name):    \n\t# Function body here\nand like this in javascript\nfunction greeting(name){    \n\t// function body here\n}\nMultiple parameters ¬ß\nYou can specify multiple parameters for functions, in most languages you can do this with a comma seperated list of names for the parameters. For example a function¬†game_over()¬†that takes in a winner and loser parameter. First in python:\ndef game_over(winner, loser):    \n\t# Function body here\nNow in javascript a¬†gameOver()¬†function with the same parameters:\nfunction gameOver(winner, loser){    \n\t// Function body here\n}\nDefault and optional values for parameters ¬ß\nYou can also specify parameters that have default values. This can be used to make common situations your functions will be run under easier, but also can be used to make some parameters optional if the value is still the default when run. Here is a function¬†feedback_form_submission()¬†that takes in data from when someone fills out a form in an app, it takes in the email of the user, and optionally a comment variable:\ndef feedback_form_submission(name, comment=&quot;&quot;):    \n\t# function body here \n\t\n# Can now call the function with a comment\nfeedback_form_submission(&quot;John Doe&quot;, &quot;What an awful event&quot;) \n \n# Or call it without a comment\nfeedback_form_submission(&quot;Kieran&quot;)\nIn python these are also called keyword arguments (kwargs for short). In javascript it would look like this\nfunction feedback_form_submission(name, comment=&quot;&quot;){    \n\t// function body here\n} \n// Can now call the function with a comment\nfeedback_form_submission(&quot;John Doe&quot;, &quot;What an awful event&quot;) \n \n// Or call it without a comment\nfeedback_form_submission(&quot;Kieran&quot;)\nTyped vs Untyped ¬ß\nThere are different types of languages, strongly and weakly typed. Strongly typed languages require you to tell the language what the types of each parameter are (integer, string, list etc.). Javascript and python are weakly typed languages, so this isn‚Äôt¬†required, but python does offer type hinting, which can be useful in ambiguous situations. If you have never heard of¬†type hints, they are used to define what data type each of the variables/attributes should be. For example a string variable called name would look like this:\nname:str\nAnd if the variable can more than one type you have the first type on one side of a | and then the other option for the type. So¬†str | None¬†would mean the variable could be a string, or a¬†None¬†like this:\nname: str|None\nWe could then apply this to our parameters like this:\ndef feedback_form_submission(name:str, comment:str=&quot;&quot;):    \n\t# function body here\nFunction Body ¬ß\nThis is where you define the code that should be run when someone calls a function. This is defined by some sort of¬†scope identifier. These scope identifiers change per language, but there are two common ones.\nIndentation ¬ß\nThe indentation level of the code is used to identify the scope in several languages. For example in python let‚Äôs define a function called¬†greet_person()¬†which takes in a name parameter which is a string and uses it to greet them:\ndef greet_person(name:str):    \n\t# Function body starts here    \n\tprint(&quot;Hello there&quot;)    \n\tprint(name)    # And ends here\nSquiglies ¬ß\nSquiflies (not the actual name) are often used as scope identifiers in languages. For example in javascript you define where a function starts and stops with everything inside squigglies ({}), so a function starts at¬†{¬†and ends at¬†}. Here is an example of a function that takes in a name, prints a greeting, then the name:\nfunction greetPerson(name){    \n\tconsole.log(&quot;Good morning&quot;)    \n\tconsole.log(name)\n}\nThis means when someone calls¬†greetPerson(&quot;kieran&quot;)¬†only the two¬†console.log()¬†statements will run!\nReturning ¬ß\nFor some functions you will want to return a resulting value. The easiest example of this is returning a number from an addition function:\ndef add(x, y):    \n\treturn x + y\nor in js\nfunction add(x, y){    \n\treturn x + y\n}\nType hinting returns ¬ß\nYou can type hint your returns the same as you can with your parameters in python. You simply add a little arrow¬†-&gt;¬†before you start the function:\ndef add(x:int, y:int)-&gt;int:    return x + y\nThis tells people what to expect when they retrieve the value of a function and store it in a variable\nRecursion ¬ß\nRecursion is the technique of running a function within a function definition. This can be used to solve problems. For example the Fibonacci sequence can be generated using:\nfunc fibonacci(n){\n\tif n == 0{\n\t\treturn 0\n\t} if n == 1{\n\t\treturn 1\n\t}\n\treturn fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)\n}\n\nSo let‚Äôs step through what happens if we were to provide n=3:\nfibonacci(3):\n  1. Return fibonacci(3-1) + fibonacci(3-2)\n  2. Do the left first fibonacci(3-1):\n\t  1. fibonacci(2)\n\t\t  1. return fibonacci(2-1) + fibonacci(2-2)\n\t\t  2. Do the left first fibonacci(2-1)\n\t\t\t  1. returns 1\n\t\t  3. Do the right\n\t\t\t  1. Returns 0\n\t\t  4. 1 + 0 = 1\n  3. Do the right\n\t  1. fibonacci(3-2)\n\t\t  1. returns 1\n  4. return 1 + 1\n\nfibonacci(3) == 2\n\n\nTo create a recursive function we need:\n\nBase case(s); When the function stops making recursive calls to itself. If we don‚Äôt have this it will recurse infinitely\nThe recursive case(s); When the function should make the recursive calls\n\nHere is the fibonacci function annotated with comments to indicate the base and recursive cases:\nfunc fibonacci(n){\n\t// 1. Base case(s)\n\tif n == 0{   // Base case 1\n\t\treturn 0\n\t} if n == 1{ // Base case 2\n\t\treturn 1\n\t}\n\n\t// 2. Recursive case\n\treturn fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)\n}\n\nEffect on scopes ¬ß\nAs mentioned earlier functions have an impact on Scoping. For example there‚Äôs a separate scope inside a function:\nx = 5\n\nfunction doStuff(){\n\tx = 3\n\t// x is 3\n}\n// x is 5\n\n\nSome languages will allow you to modify values in outer scopes, and in those cases x would be 3. But in most languages x would be 5 at the second comment. Look into the language specifics of your language to understand this.\nLoops ¬ß\nLoops are a concept in programming that allows you to run some code for a defined number of times. This means if you have an operation you want to run 1000 times, or maybe run some code for every user in a database, or show a menu until someone makes a choice in a game, loops are what you want.\nParts of a loop ¬ß\nLoops have two main parts, the loop definition, and the loop body. The loop definition defines how long the loop should run for, and/or what data is available inside the loop. The loop body defines what runs inside the loop. There are two popular ways this is done in languages, indentation or squiggly braces:\n*Not real code\nloop definition:    \n\tloop body \n \nloop definition{    \n\tloop body\n}\nIn the first (used by languages like python) everything that is indented will run for each¬†Iteration of the loop, in the second everything inside the {} will run.\nIteration ¬ß\nIterators is the name given to types of data that are designed to be looped over. For example if you have some text then in most languages that will be an iterator where you will start at the first letter and be able to loop through each letter one at a time.\nYou can also usually create your own iterators so that for example if you have some code generating a slideshow you could create an iterator that loops through each slide. The only thing that matters is that you can define a start, an end, and some way to get from one item to another (sometimes items in iterators are called elements).\nIterators ¬ß\nIterators is the name given to types of data that are designed to be looped over. More details can be found here.\nloop Types ¬ß\nThere are several different types of loops that exist and are used in different situations. Most problems you run into can be approached with more than one option, so pick which one you think works best for you.\nFor ¬ß\nFor loops run for a length of time defined by what you are trying to loop over. There is a section below that explains when to use each!\nC-style ¬ß\nC-Style for loops are what most languages call for loops. They will allow you to define a variable that starts at some value, define an end condition and then loop until the variable equals that condition. Below is an idea of how this might work:\n*Not real code\nindex = 0\n\nfor index until index is 10:\n    print(&quot;Hello&quot;)\n    index += 1\n\n\nIn the above example index starts at 0, on each iteration it will print hello, and then the index has 1 added to it. The loop runs until the index variable is 10 which is when the loop ends.\nThis can be done in python like so:\nfor index in range(10):\n    # Python automatically starts at 0 \n    # &amp; adds 1 to index per itteration\n    print(&quot;hello&quot;)\nor Javascript like so:\nfor (let index = 0; index &lt; 10; index++) {\n    console.log(&quot;hello&quot;);\n}\nForeach ¬ß\nFor each loops are a bit different than regular for loops. In a regular for loop you will use integers (numbers) to control how the loop works. Whereas a foreach loop will loop over each item/element in an iterator.\nFor example lets say you have a shopping list, and want to print each item in the shopping list, you can do something like this:\n*Not real code\nshopping_list = [&quot;eggs&quot;, &quot;ham&quot;, &quot;spam&quot;]\nforeach item in shopping_list:\n    print(item)\n\nThis loop would print ‚Äúeggs‚Äù, then ‚Äúham‚Äù, then ‚Äúspam‚Äù. By default python is one of the only languages that uses foreach as it‚Äôs for loop. So here is the above example in python:\nshopping_list = [&quot;eggs&quot;, &quot;ham&quot;, &quot;spam&quot;]\nfor item in shopping_list:\n    print(item)\nWhen you use the range() function in python it actually just generates a list to loop over with a foreach loop. So these two would be the same:\nfor index in range(10):\n    print(index)\n \nfor index in [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]:\n    print(index)\nforeach is implemented differently in different languages. Javascript for example runs the loop directly on the data you want to loop over:\nshopping_list = [&quot;eggs&quot;, &quot;ham&quot;, &quot;spam&quot;]\n \nshopping_list.forEach(item =&gt; {\n    // This would be your &quot;loop body&quot;\n    console.log(item)\n});\nWhen to use each ¬ß\nBoth of these two for loops have advantages and disadvantages. But here are some rules of thumb\nC-style: If you want to make modifications to items, just want to use numbers or foreach isn‚Äôt available\nforeach: If you want to only read data. Some data types will let you make modifications in foreach loops, but not all of them and not in every language. If you have a list of numbers for example and you add 1 to it, then that change won‚Äôt save in a lot of languages. Here‚Äôs a python example:\nnumbers = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]\n \nfor number in numbers:\n    number += 1\n \nprint(numbers) # still [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]\nFor this to work you would need a c-style loop:\nnumbers = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]\n \nlength_numbers = len(numbers)\n \nfor index in range(length_numbers):\n    numbers[index]  += 1\n \nprint(numbers) # now [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nwhile ¬ß\nwhile loops are used to run until a certain condition is met. They basically run until whatever condition specified is true. So for example this might be a while loop that would run 10 times:\n*Not real code\nnumber = 0\n\nwhile number &lt; 10:\n    number += 1\n\nIn this case the loop would run 10 times, then on the 10th run number would be 10 and number&lt;10 would be false, which would end the loop. This can be useful for tons of things, but the most common is game loops and menus. In games you can have something like:\n*Not real code\ngame_over = false\n\nwhile not game_over:\n    play_game()\n\nWhich would run until the game_over variable is set to true (perhaps when a player dies). This can be done with menus as well to wait for someone to select something, or anything that can be controlled with a boolean!\nHere are the above examples in python:\nnumber = 0\n \nwhile number &lt; 10:\n    number += 1\n \ngame_over = False\n \nwhile not game_over:\n    play_game()\nand in javascript:\nnumber = 0\n \nwhile (number &lt; 10){\n    number += 1\n}\n \ngame_over = false\n \nwhile (!game_over){\n    play_game()\n}\nInfinite loops ¬ß\nYou need to make sure your while loop can end. Most programming languages will not stop you from making a loop that never ends!\nloops and collections ¬ß\nThese sorts of loops can be very handy when used with Collections. Since collections take multiple steps if you want to run code on everything in them they are a perfect candidate for loops!\nFor loops ¬ß\nLet‚Äôs say for example someone updated their difficulty in a game so you want to increase enemy HP, you could do something like this:\n*Not real code\nindex = 0\n\nenemies = [enemy_1, enemy_2, enemny_3]\n\nfor index until index is length(enemies):\n    increase_hp(enemies[index])\n\nWhen accessing values in a list/array (enemies) you can access each item by it‚Äôs index. So in this case enemies[0] would give you enemy_1. Since we start at 0 (all arrays/lists do) and then go until the index is the length of the list, we go through each element and run increase_hp() on it. So these two are the same:\n*Not real code\nincrease_hp(enemies[0])\nincrease_hp(enemy_1)\n\nHere is the same example in python:\nenemies = [enemy_1, enemy_2, enemy_3]\n \nlength_of_enemies = len(enemies)\n \nfor index in range(length_of_enemies):\n    increase_hp(enemies[index])\nand in Javascript:\nenemies = [enemy_1, enemy_2, enemy_3];\n \nlengthOfEnemies = enemies.length;\n \nfor (let index = 0; index &lt; lengthOfEnemies; index++) {\n    increase_hp(enemies[index]);\n}\nWhile loops ¬ß\nLet‚Äôs say for example someone updated their difficulty in a game so you want to increase enemy HP, you could do something like this:\nindex = 0\n\nenemies = [enemy_1, enemy_2, enemny_3]\n\nwhile index &lt; length(enemies):\n    increase_hp(enemies[index])\n    index += 1\n\nWhen accessing values in a list/array (enemies) you can access each item by it‚Äôs index. So in this case enemies[0] would give you enemy_1. Since we start at 0 (all arrays/lists do) and then go until the index is the length of the list, we go through each element and run increase_hp() on it. So these two are the same:\nincrease_hp(enemies[0])\nincrease_hp(enemy_1)\n\nHere is the same example in python:\nenemies = [enemy_1, enemy_2, enemy_3]\n \nlength_of_enemies = len(enemies)\n \nindex = 0\n \nwhile (index &lt; length_of_enemies):\n    increase_hp(enemies[index])\n    index += 1\nand in Javascript:\nenemies = [enemy_1, enemy_2, enemy_3];\n \nlengthOfEnemies = enemies.length;\n \nindex = 0\n \nwhile (index &lt; lengthOfEnemies) {\n    increase_hp(enemies[index]);\n    index += 1;\n}\nOther aspects of loops ¬ß\nSometimes you want more manual control over a loop. For example let‚Äôs say you want to end a loop early, or skip an item if some condition is true. There are built in options to most languages to do this.\nbreak ¬ß\nBreak can be used to end a loop early. This can be useful if you are looping over something, and want to allow the loop to stop running if the word ‚Äústop‚Äù is encountered:\nforeach word in words:\n    if word == &quot;stop&quot;:\n        break\n\nThis would break out of the loop when stop is encountered or when it reaches the end of the list if stop isn‚Äôt there.\nHere is an example in python:\nfor word in words:\n    if word == &quot;stop&quot;:\n        break\nand in javascript\nwords.forEach(word =&gt; {\n    if (word == &quot;stop&quot;){\n        break\n    }\n});\ncontinue ¬ß\ncontinue can be used to ‚Äúskip‚Äù an iteration. For example lets say you want to add 1 to a number if it is even. You could do something like this to skip odd numbers:\nnumbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6]\nlength_of_numbers = numbers.length\n\nindex = 0\n\nfor index until index is length_of_numbers:\n    if isOdd(numbers[index]):\n        continue\n    else:\n        numbers[index] += 1\n\nHere is an example of this in python:\nnumbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6]\nlength_of_numbers = len(numbers)\n \nfor index in range(length_of_numbers):\n    if not (numbers[index]%2==0): # Is odd number\n        continue\n    else:\n        numbers[index] +=1\nand in javascript:\nnumbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6]\nlength_of_numbers = numbers.length\n \nfor (let index = 0; index &lt; length_of_numbers; index++) {\n    if (!(numbers[index]%2)==0){\n        continue\n    } else{\n        numbers[index] +=1\n    }\n}\nAdditional Resources ¬ß\n\nProgramming Languages\n\nWhat is a Programming Language (youtube.com)\nWhat is Programming?

Base 10 gives us 10 values before we shift digits. We go from 0-9, and then we shift 1 digit left, and start from 0 in the far right column again:\n0\n1\n2\n...\n9\n10\n11\n...\n19\n20\n21\n...\n99\n100\n\nIf we pad the left hand side of the columns with 0‚Äôs (which doesn‚Äôt change the value) this pattern becomes more apparent:\n\nWe end up essentially with a table. So if we think about it the number 123 is actually:\n\n1 one hundred\n1 twenty\n1 three\n\nEach representing the hundreds, tens and one‚Äôs columns of the above table. As such when a value ‚Äúspills over‚Äù it increases the digit by adding 1 to the left column of whatever overflows.\nPowers of 10 ¬ß\nAnother way to view this is in powers of 10. I have put the minimum value of each column on top, and the maximum below:\n\nThis same model will be used later to help explain other base numbering systems like binary and hex.\nBinary ¬ß\nComputers communicate using electrical signals. With these electrical signals we can represent 2 states, on and off. If the voltage is above 5v we can call it ‚Äúon‚Äù or ‚Äútrue‚Äù, and if the voltage is below that we can call if ‚Äúoff‚Äù or ‚Äúfalse‚Äù. With this system it lends itself towards binary. Binary is a base 2 numbering system. Base 2 means instead of 0-9 we have only 2 values, 1 and 0. In binary these 1‚Äôs and 0‚Äôs are called bits. We can have different sized binary numbers. For example this is a 4 bit binary number 0110 (6 in decimal), or an 8 bit number 01100110 (102 in decimal), 8 bits is traditionally called a byte.\nWhen you first start looking at the numbers, binary is easiest to think of as a kind of truth table format. Let‚Äôs start with an example, the number 123 is 0b1111011. the 0b is a base indicator, when we write numbers we need to know what system we‚Äôre using, the b indicates we‚Äôre in binary. So 123 is  1111011. How do we do this conversion?\nConverting decimal numbers to binary ¬ß\nFirst we need to construct a table like we saw with the Powers of 10 decimal representation we‚Äôre going to start from 2^0, and we want to go to 2^x where x is the largest power of 2 that does not exceed our number. For 123 2^7 = 128 which is larger than 123, so 2^6 is the magic number we want. For the steps I will include 2^7 to help show the steps clearly, but this wastes 1 bit of space storing our number. So let‚Äôs build our table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2^72^62^52^42^32^22^12^0\nWhich we can convert to whole numbers from the exponents to make it easier:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1286432168421\nThere is a video walkthrough of this section if you are interested.\n\nThe continuous subtract Algorithm ¬ß\nAs we saw with decimal earlier, we can break up numbers into their constituent parts, so for 123 it‚Äôs 1 one hundred 2 tens (twenty) and 3 ones (three). Now we have the table we are going to do the same, but broken up into powers of 2. Our algorithm for creating a binary number from a decimal is:\n\nKeep track of a value called remainder, at the start remainder is equal to our decimal number\nStart from the far left of the table for each cell\n\nif remainder &lt; current cell: put a 0 and go one cell to the right\nelse: put a 1 subtract the current cell value from remainder, and then move to the right\n\n\nContinue step 2 until you reach the end of the table.\n\nYou can do this by building a string, and converting it back to a number later. The pseudocode for this would be:\nfunction convertToBinary(number){\n  remainder = number\n  \n  // Assume 8 bits\n  cells = [128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1]\n\n  result = &quot;0b&quot; // Where we will add bits 1 at a time to\n  \n  for currentCell in cells{\n    if remainder &lt; currentCell{\n      result.append(&quot;0&quot;)\n    } else {\n      result.append(&quot;1&quot;)\n      remainder = remainder - currentCell\n    }\n  }\n  \n  // Some function to take the string representation and convert to a number\n  return stringToBinary(result) \n  \n}\n\n\n\nFor example the algorithm in python:\ndef convert_to_binary(number:int) -&gt; str:\n  remainder = number # Step 1\n \n  # Assume 8 bits\n  cells = [128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1]\n  result = &quot;0b&quot; # Where we will add bits 1 at a time to\n \n  for currentCell in cells:\n    if remainder &lt; currentCell: # Step 2.1\n      result += &quot;0&quot;\n    else: # Step 2.2\n      result += &quot;1&quot;\n      remainder = remainder - currentCell\n  return result\n \nx = convert_to_binary(123) # 01111011\n \n# Converts back to decimal\nint(x, 2) # 123\n \n# Can also create an int from a binary number\n0b01111011 == 123\nFirst Cell\nSo to start:\nRemainder = 123\nCurrent Cell = 128\nremainder &lt; Current Cell\n\nSo we follow step 2.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12864321684210\nSecond Cell\nNext:\nRemainder = 123\nCurrent Cell = 64\nremainder &gt; Current Cell\n\nSo we follow step 2.2\nremainder = remainder - Current Cell\n          = 123 - 64\n          = 59\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n128643216842101\nThird Cell\nNow we continue:\nRemainder = 59\nCurrent Cell = 32\nremainder &gt; Current Cell\n\nSo we follow step 2.2\nremainder = remainder - Current Cell\n          = 59 - 32\n          = 27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1286432168421011\nFourth Cell\nRemainder = 27\nCurrent Cell = 16\nremainder &gt; Current Cell\n\nSo we follow step 2.2\nremainder = remainder - Current Cell\n          = 27 - 16\n          = 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12864321684210111\nFifth Cell\nRemainder = 11\nCurrent Cell = 8\nremainder &gt; Current Cell\n\nSo we follow step 2.2\nremainder = remainder - Current Cell\n          = 11 - 8\n          = 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n128643216842101111\nSixth Cell\nRemainder = 3\nCurrent Cell = 4\nremainder &lt; Current Cell\n\nSo we follow step 2.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1286432168421011110\nSeventh Cell\nRemainder = 3\nCurrent Cell = 2\nremainder &gt; Current Cell\n\nSo we follow step 2.2\nremainder = remainder - Current Cell\n          = 3 - 2\n          = 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12864321684210111101\nEighth Cell\nRemainder = 1\nCurrent Cell = 1\nremainder &gt; Current Cell\n\nSo we follow step 2.2\nremainder = remainder - Current Cell\n          = 1 - 1\n          = 0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n128643216842101111011\nSo we‚Äôre now left with 01111011, and we just add our indicator to the front and we have 0b01111011. Here‚Äôs a familiar way to visualize this process:\n\nYou know you‚Äôve done it right if your remainder is 0.\nConverting binary numbers to decimal ¬ß\nNow we‚Äôve seen how to convert number to binary, let‚Äôs see about how to convert numbers from binary to decimal.\nThe continuous add Algorithm ¬ß\nNow we have the table our algorithm for creating a binary number from a decimal is:\n\nKeep track of a value called result, at the start result is equal to 0\nStart from the far right of the table for each cell\n\nif the value is a 1, add the value of the current cell to result\nIf the value is 0, go to the next cell\n\n\nContinue step 2 until you reach the end of the table\n\nThe pseudocode for this would be:\nfunction convertToInteger(binary_number){\n  remainder = number\n\n  // Assume 8 bits\n  cells = [1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128]\n\n  // Create an array of the 0&#039;s and 1&#039;s of the number\n  values = binary_number.split(&quot;&quot;) \n\n  result = 0 // Where we will add 1 cell at a time\n\n  // Iterate the cells and values at the same time\n  for value, currentCell in values, cells{\n\t if value == 1{\n\t\t result += currentCell\n\t } \n    \n  }\n  \n  return result\n}\n\nconvertToInteger(&quot;01111011&quot;)\n\nFor example the algorithm in python:\ndef convert_to_decimal(number:str) -&gt; int:\n  result = 0 # Step 1\n \n  # Assume 8 bits\n  cells = [128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1]\n  cells = cells[::-1] # Reverse cells (simulates iterating from the right to left)\n \n  number = number.replace(&quot;0b&quot;,&quot;&quot;) # Remove binary indicator\n \n  for index, currentCell in enumerate(cells): # Step 2\n      if index == len(number): # Is at end\n          break  # Break so we don&#039;t double-add last value\n \n      # Get current Value from end of list\n      if number[-1*(index+1)] ==&quot;1&quot;: # Step 2.1 \n          result += currentCell\n  return result\n \nx = bin(0b01111011)\n \nconvert_to_decimal(x) # 123\nSo if we were to take 0b01111011 and convert it to an integer we would start from the rightmost (least significant bit), to the left it would go:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1286432168421011110111+2+8+16+64 = 123\n\nSigned vs Unsigned ¬ß\nWhen talking about binary there are two possible representations, signed and unsigned. Signed numbers are numbers that allow negatives and positives as well as 0 (and sometimes negative 01). An unsigned integer however is only able to be positive. On top of this signed integers have multiple binary representations for how they show negatives and positives.\nSigned magnitude ¬ß\nSigned magnitude binary will have a sign bit (usually the leftmost bit [also called Most Significant bit or MSB]), which indicates if a value is positive or negative. Traditionally a 0 is positive, and 1 is negative. Since you have a sign bit you always lose 1 bit of data. So an 8 bit (1 byte) unsigned binary integer goes from being able to represent 0-255, to a signed integer being only able to represent -127-127. Unsigned on the other hand allows the leftmost bit to be part of the number, at the expense of no negative numbers being representable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSigned (binary)Unsigned (binary)00000000 = 000000000 = 010000000 = -010000000 = 12800000001 = 100000001 = 110000001 = -110000001 = 12810000110 = -610000110 = 134\nAll are 8 bits (1 byte)\nTwo‚Äôs compliment ¬ß\nMuch more commonly people represent signed integers using two‚Äôs compliment form. This is a bit more complicated to implement, but has advantages, especially:\n\nit makes binary operations2 the same as unsigned values\nYou don‚Äôt need -0 and 0, just 0\n\nFor any number you follow the following algorithm:\n\nRepresent the number in unsigned binary\nConvert the number into one‚Äôs compliment (flip all bits, so 0 becomes 1, and 1 becomes 0)\nAdd a 1 to the end\n\nFor example to represent -115 we would do:\n\nRepresent the number in unsigned binary: 0b01110011\nConvert the number into one‚Äôs compliment (flip all bits, so 0 becomes 1, and 1 becomes 0): 0b10001100\nAdd a 1 to the end: 0b10001100 + 0b0000001 = 0b10001101\n\n\nOperations in Binary ¬ß\nYou can do various operations in binary to manipulate values as needed. Some of these are the same normal math we would do with any numbers, but there are also special operations we use in binary for the typical uses for binary.\nBit Shifting ¬ß\nBit shifting does what it sounds like. A bit shift left will have you take all the bits in a binary number and move them one bit left. For example 0b00011000 bit shifted left 1 bit would give you 0b00110000.  Here are the remaining bit shifts:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameSymbolDescriptionExampleShift left&lt;&lt;Shifts all bits to the left0b0011 &lt;&lt; 1 == 0b0110Arithmetic shift right&gt;&gt;Shifts bits to the right, the shift will maintain and pad with it‚Äôs sign bit instead of 00b1011 &gt;&gt; 2 == 0b1110Logical shift right&gt;&gt;&gt;Shifts bits to the right, the shift will pad with 0‚Äôs0b1011 &gt;&gt; 2 == 0b00103\nThere are binary operation (as in needs 2 arguments) and unary operation (needs only 1 argument) forms of bit shifting. For example 0b0100 &lt;&lt; == 0b100 is the unary form, where it‚Äôs assumed you want to shift left by 1, the binary operation form let‚Äôs you specify how far to shift by, such as 0b0010 &lt;&lt; 2 == 0b1000.\nOverflows ¬ß\nAn overflow occurs in two circumstances, a shift left when the most significant bit is a 1 (0b10000000 &lt;&lt; 1), or a shift right when the least significant bit is a 1 (0b00000001 &gt;&gt; 1 or 0b00000001 &gt;&gt;&gt; 1). In these cases there are various ways of handling the situation, in some cases there is a carry-in or carry-out bit, where there is a defined way to deal with these situations. In most languages however this just causes an overflow where the value is thrown away.\nYou do need to be careful about overflows because they can pose significant security risks in situations4 5.\nBit Masking ¬ß\nBit masking is a technique where you mask a binary number, using another number in order to define a set of bits you want to perform an operation on. Similar to putting painters tape on a wall to define where you want paint to go, and where you don‚Äôt want it to go. Let‚Äôs say we take the 4 bit mask 0b0001, this mask indicates that we only care about the least significant bit in the number. From there we can do various logical operations over that ‚Äúfield‚Äù of bits. This has a ton of uses, but the simplest is to check 1 bit for something.\nLet‚Äôs say we want to know if the 6th bit from the right is a 1, we could take our input number, use a bitmask, and perform a logical AND operation. If both are a 1, it will be a 1, else the 6th bit will be a 0. Therefore the only two possible values given the bitmask are 0 or 32.\nSo for example:\n   0b11011011 (input)\n&amp;  0b00100000 (mask)\n--------------\n   0b00000000\n\nGoing from least significant bit to most we perform the AND operation on each bit, but since every bit is 0 except the 6th, every other number is guaranteed to be 0. So the most important check is the sixth bit, where 0 &amp; 1 == 0, so we know the 6th bit is 0, since the whole number is 0.\nThis may seem useless, but it‚Äôs a powerful tool when combined with other operations. For example lots of hardware uses the binary enumeration method to change the settings for hardware on a computer. Let‚Äôs say the 3rd bit decides if the hardware is on or off. We can just use something like XOR to toggle the current setting whenever the user wants to make the change. This means we can trivially do the toggle in a single line of code: input XOR 0b00000100. This will toggle the third bit without us even having to check it. These operations can make things much more efficient.\nAddition ¬ß\nFor unsigned addition you can do it column by column, for each column:\n\nIf there are two 1‚Äôs, carry the bit to the next column\nIf there is one 1, the result is 1\nIf there are no one‚Äôs the result is 0\nHere is an example:\n\n   0b0101  (5)\n+  0b0011  (3)\n---------\n   0b1000  (8)\n\nThe steps would look like this\n\nConsider a case now with overflow\n   0b10010110    (150)\n+  0b10000110    (134)\n-------------\n   0b100011100   (284)\n\nIn this case we need the overflow bit to represent our number, so we can‚Äôt throw it away, instead we have to increase our bits. With unsigned two‚Äôs compliment values we have two overflows that will break our operations:\n\nWhen two negative numbers are summed and result is positive\n\n   0b1001 (-7)\n + 0b1101 (-3)\n--------------\n  0b10110 (-10) --&gt; becomes 0b0110 (6)\n\n\nWhen two positive numbers are summed and result is negative\n\n   0b0111 (7)\n + 0b0001 (1)\n--------------\n  0b1000 (-8)\n\nSubtraction ¬ß\n‚Ä¶\n\nBinary Addition and Subtraction With Negative Numbers, 2‚Äôs Complements &amp; Signed Magnitude (youtube.com)\n\nMultiplication ¬ß\nBinary multiplication is similar to decimal multiplication but involves only the digits 0 and 1. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step algorithm for binary multiplication:\n\n\nWrite down the numbers:\nWrite the two binary numbers you want to multiply, one below the other.\n   1101  (Multiplier)\nx   101  (Multiplicand)\n\n\n\nMultiply each bit:\nStarting from the rightmost bit of the multiplier, multiply each bit by the entire multiplicand, just as you would in decimal multiplication. Write the intermediate products below each line.\n      1101  (Multiplier)\n   x   101  (Multiplicand)\n   -----------\n      1101  (Partial product when multiplied by 1)\n   1101    (Shifted partial product when multiplied by 0)\n   -----------\n  100001  (Result of the multiplication)\n\n\n\nAdd up the partial products:\nAdd up all the partial products to get the final result.\n      1101  (Multiplier)\n   x   101  (Multiplicand)\n   -----------\n      1101  (Partial product when multiplied by 1)\n   1101    (Shifted partial product when multiplied by 0)\n   -----------\n  100001  (Result of the multiplication)\n\n\n\nSo, in this example, the binary multiplication result is 100001.\nDivision ¬ß\nDivision in binary follows a process similar to division in decimal, but the base is 2 instead of 10. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step algorithm for binary division:\n\n\nAlign the Numbers:\nAlign the divisor with the leftmost part of the dividend. If the divisor is larger than the dividend, the quotient is 0, and the remainder is the dividend itself.\n   110101  (Dividend)\n/   101   (Divisor)\n\n\n\nInitialize:\nSet the quotient to zero and bring down the first digit of the dividend.\n   110101  (Dividend)\n/   101   (Divisor)\n  |\n   1\n\n\n\nDivide:\nCompare the divisor with the current partial dividend. If it‚Äôs less than or equal to the partial dividend, subtract the divisor from the partial dividend, add 1 to the quotient, and bring down the next digit of the dividend. Otherwise, add a 0 to the quotient and bring down the next digit.\n   110101  (Dividend)\n/   101   (Divisor)\n  |  \n   1       (Quotient)\n  -101\n   -----\n    010\n\n\n\nRepeat:\nRepeat step 3 until you have brought down all the digits of the dividend.\n   110101  (Dividend)\n/   101   (Divisor)\n    1       (Quotient)\n  -101\n   -----\n    010\n     10\n   -----\n     01\n\n\n\nResult:\nThe final quotient is the result, and the remainder is the remaining partial dividend.\n   110101  (Dividend)\n/   101   (Divisor)\n    1.01    (Quotient)\n  -101\n   -----\n    010\n     10\n   -----\n     01\n\n\n\nSo, in this example, the binary division result is Quotient = 1.01 and Remainder = 01.\nUses &amp; tricks ¬ß\nBinary in general is the basis of all computing, but what are some uses where interacting with binary is actually better than working with base 10. These cases typically are for efficiency and/or simplicity.\nBinary Enumeration &amp; Booleans ¬ß\nEnumerators can be made with a binary number by interpreting the bits as one of the two available values. For example let‚Äôs say we have some user settings in an app like:\npremium: true or false\nadult: true or false\nuseMobileData: true or false\ntheme: light or dark\n\nEach of these user settings can be assigned a 1 (true/light) or 0 (false/dark). Therefore we could represent the entire state of the user with a 4 bit binary number. For example 0b1010 would indicate that the user is premium, not an adult, allows the use of mobile data and prefers a dark scheme:\npremium: 1 (true)\nadult: 0 (false)\nuseMobileData: 1 (true)\ntheme: 0 (dark)\n\nLeast Significant Bit Stenography ¬ß\nWhen looking at pixels there‚Äôs an encoding used where each pixel has 3 associated numbers between 0-255. So each pixel can be represented by 3 bytes (i.e. 0b11111111, 0b00000000, 0b11111101). So in this case [255, 0, 253] correspond to the amount of Red, Green, and Blue of that pixel. So in this case it‚Äôs very red, has no green, and has a lot of blue, which gives us:\n\nSo let‚Äôs say we wanted to secretly store a 9 bit message, and we have the following pixels:\n\nSo if we wanted to store 0b111111111 we just add the message to the least significant (leftmost) bit of each pixel:\n\nThis is what the modified image would look like. There‚Äôs almost no perceptual difference, but you can now read the leftmost bit of each integer and get back our message.\nOdds and evens ¬ß\nHow can you tell if a number is odd or even in base 10? You divide by 0 and check if there‚Äôs a remainder (you can use modulus to do this 4 % 2 == 0 therefore even). But for binary it‚Äôs much faster, if the least significant bit is 1 the number is odd, else it‚Äôs even. So for example without calculating 0b00110101 00110101 I know it‚Äôs even because the rightmost bit is a 1.\nThe reason for this is because all powers of 2 except 2^1 are even, and summing any two even numbers is even. So any number that is odd must have a 1 in the rightmost bit so that it can be a non-power of 2 number.\nDHCP masks ¬ß\nIn order to use the internet your router has to have an IP address for each device that wants to communicate. This would be tedious to do by hand (called static allocation), so instead we often use DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) to automatically rent IP addresses to devices. For IP addresses we use four 1 byte numbers to indicate an IP address. A DHCP subnet mask  allows you to specify how many IP addresses and which pattern to use.\nFor each mask you subtract 255 from the octet ant it tells you how many addresses are available. So for example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigured base IPSubnet maskRange of addresses10.0.0.0255.255.255.25510.0.0.010.0.0.0255.255.255.010.0.0.0-10.0.0.255172.0.0.0255.255.255.0172.0.0.0-172.0.0.255172.0.0.0255.255.0.0172.0.0.0-172.0.255.25510.0.0.0255.255.255.12810.0.0.0-10.0.0.128\nHexadecimal ¬ß\nHexadecimal is a base 16 system. It works similar to binary and base 10, but the counting goes 0-9 then A-F. So for example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecimalBinaryHexadecimal10b000000010x0190b000010010x09100b000010100x0A110b000010110x0B120b000011000x0C130b000011010x0D140b000011100x0E150b000011110x0F160b000100000x10170b000100010x11\nUses &amp; Tricks ¬ß\nHex has a ton of uses, many of them align with binary, and also relating to large values because hexadecimal is a more dense representation than even base 10.\nAddressing ¬ß\nBecause you can represent much larger numbers with hexadecimal it‚Äôs used to indicate locations in memory. This comes up often when you‚Äôre talking about pointers.\nColour Values ¬ß\nIn many systems you can represent colours using ‚Äúhex codes‚Äù. These are just hexadecimal numbers under the hood. The numbers themselves correspond to the amount of red, green and blue that makes up a colour (from 0-255). So for example 0xFF00FD would give a pink pixel like:\n\nThere are also ones that add alpha channel (how transparent it is). For example 0xFF00FDFF would produce the same as above 0xFF00FD7F would be the same, but at %50 transparency and 0xFF00FD00 would be the same colour but fully transparent. A tool to visualize this can be found here.\nOther Base systems ¬ß\nThere is a base numbering system for about any numbered base. Most of them have very little practical use, but here are a few:\n\nBase 12 (duodecimal or dozenal)\n\nHandy for times\n\n60 (seconds, minutes), 24 (1 day, hours in military time), and 12(hours in am/pm) are divisible by 12, which makes it easy to count seconds, minutes, hours, and days\n\n\nDuodecimal - Wikipedia\nBase 12 - Numberphile (youtube.com)\nBase 12: An Introduction | Built In\nThe Base Some Computers Use Instead of Binary (youtube.com)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecimalDuodecimal/dozenalPronunciation10X or ùõòdek11E or ‚Ñ∞el1210doe1614doe-four221X or 1ùõòdoe-dek231E or 1‚Ñ∞doe-el2420two-doe2521two-doe-one6050five-doe120X0 or ùõò0dek-doe132E0 or ‚Ñ∞0el-doe144100doe-doe or gross\n\nBase 3 (ternary)\n\nUsed in some logic systems to develop software, and some physics\nEach value is called a trit (instead of bit like binary)\nThree-valued logic - Wikipedia\nTernary System - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics\n5.4: Ternary Systems - Engineering LibreTexts\nDouglas W.

Imagine you work in a bakery. If you wait until someone orders a loaf of bread to cook it, then now every person who comes into your store has to wait for you to cook the loaf before they can leave.\n\nInstead if there‚Äôs usually 10 people who come in to buy loaves of bread, you can pre-cook them, and have them ready to buy. This skips the whole baking time waiting because you‚Äôve already done it ahead of time. At worst if you‚Äôre out of pre-made bread, it takes the same amount of time as the original bakery\n\nA cache is the same idea. Let‚Äôs say you have a website with 25 pages, instead of having to open the file every time a user asks for the page you could just read the most popular pages (let‚Äôs say 10) and store them in memory. This way whenever people ask for those pages you don‚Äôt have to go and fetch them because you can just grab them from memory.\nMemory vs Storage ¬ß\nStorage in the context of this article is used to describe data that is stored persistently on SSD (solid-state drive(s)) and/or HDD (Hard-Disk Drives). You will see the word memory used a lot in this page, this is referring to system memory, which is a combination of RAM (Random Access Memory) and Level Caches. There are three major distinctions between memory and storage\n\nCapacity: Memory has significantly less overall size compared to storage\nSpeed: while memory has less it can store, it can retrieve and store data much faster than storage\nVolatility: Memory is volatile meaning it is wiped whenever the parts are no longer receiving electricity, unlike storage which is etched into the disk\n\n\nA Note About The Examples ¬ß\nThe examples all have a fake database system. This is not real code that will run. This would be replaced with however you actually access your data in code. It‚Äôs just there to help illustrate a point. Here are the functions and the info about them\n\ndatabase.connect(); Returns an object with the database that has¬†.get(table, key)¬†and¬†.store(table, key, value)¬†methods\ndb.get(table,key); A method on the database object that gets the information from a specified table with a given key. For example¬†db.get(&quot;user&quot;, userID)¬†gets data from the user table that has a given user ID\ndb.store(table, key, value); A method on the database object that stores information in a given table for a given key with a given value. For example¬†db.store(&quot;user&quot;, user_id, data), stores a key at¬†user_id¬†in the¬†user¬†table with the¬†data¬†provided\n\nSimple Example (memoization) ¬ß\nOne of the simplest forms of caching is called memoization. Essentially you can have a function that takes in some parameters, and on the first run store the result in something like a hashmap/dictionary/list/array to look up the next time the function is called with the same parameters. For example let‚Äôs say you have a function that gets data about a user from a database by an id (an integer). Something like this:\njs\nfunction getUser(userID){          // Connect and get database object    \n    db = database.connect();       // Query for user and return data    \n    return db.get(&quot;user&quot;, userID);\n}\npython\ndef get_user(user_id: int):     # Connect and get database object    \n    db = database.connect()     # Query for user and return data    \n    return db.get(&quot;user&quot;, user_id)\nIn these two snippets there‚Äôs some sort of database system we need to connect to, then query for the data, and return it. This is fine, but what if we have 1000 queries at once? or the database is in one country, and the server is in another? We now have to wait for the connection every time. Often with something like this we might be making duplicate calls, like for example if there‚Äôs a profile page, or some user data that shows up across an app (profile pic etc.). What if instead we could store the results of the queries so that even just duplicate queries don‚Äôt need to happen. Here‚Äôs how we could do this:\njs\nconst users = new Map(); // Store results of user queries\n \nfunction getUser(userID){\n    if (!users.has(userID)){ // New ID\n        // Connect and get database object\n        db = database.connect(); \n        // Query for user\n        data = db.get(&quot;user&quot;, userID);\n        // Store data for next time\n        users.set(userID, data)\n        return data\n    } else{\n        return users.get(userID)\n    }\n}\npython\nusers = dict() # Store results of user queries\n \ndef get_user(user_id: int):\n    user_data = users.get(user_id, False)\n    if not user_data: # New user ID\n        # Connect and get database object\n        db = database.connect() \n        # Query for user\n        data = db.get(&quot;user&quot;, user_id)\n        # Store for next time\n        users[user_id] = data \n        return data\n    else:\n        return user_data\n \nSo if we called the function with the user ID 1, it will check if 1 exists in the map/dictionary, since it‚Äôs empty at the start it will then go and connect to the database, get the data and add it to the map/dictionary. Later on if we called the function again with the ID of 1 it would check the map/dictionary, see the value and just return it right away.\nPython does have a built in one-liner to do this sort of thing inside¬†the functools package.\nPre-fetches/Pre-caches ¬ß\nMemoization is great, but there are tons of other caching strategies that can be more useful. For example let‚Äôs say you run a ticket app for buying movie tickets. If most people will buy a ticket 1 hour in advance of the showtime, you might want to cache the data for each movie in the system 1 hour before showtime since it‚Äôs likely to be needed then.\nThis method is called pre-fetching. Essentially you are guessing based on trends when you will need data, and preparing the most likely data you will need ahead of time. This can help in systems where you might end up with a lot of stress all at once, like for example game servers where the most popular time iis 5-8pm in each country because that‚Äôs when people get home from work/school. So you can rotate prefetching server data for each country around when this peak time is!\nLayers of Caches ¬ß\nThere is rarely a system you will run into that only has one cache. There will often be multiple caches for multiple purposes interacting with each other. You might make a request for a webpage that compiles it‚Äôs data from a few dozen caches all at once.\nLet‚Äôs examine what might happen for example when using a browser to get a webpage.\nDevice/OS Cache ¬ß\nYour operating system on the device you‚Äôre using to read this article will have tons of caches built in. These device/OS caches have tons of use cases. For example you may cache the information of bluetooth devices you have connected to in the past, so you don‚Äôt have to re-ask the device for it‚Äôs information every time you pair it.\nBrowser Cache ¬ß\nNow that you have the device level caches, the browser itself will often have it‚Äôs own caches. It might maintain stored information about you (passwords, name, address etc.),¬†DNS information, and even caches of pages you‚Äôve recently visited, so it doesn‚Äôt have to even go to the network for every request.\nServer/CDN cache ¬ß\nNow that you‚Äôve made the request for a page on the browser, the page you get returned back, might even just be a cache. Sometimes this comes in the form of caching like we‚Äôve seen (memoization etc.), or it might use a CDN. A CDN is basically a system that exists just to store static (unchanging) content to be distributed to users quickly. This means static pages are stored, and the server running the app doesn‚Äôt even get asked for the content, instead the CDN just gives it old cached copies.\nFull Example ¬ß\nSo if we were to request¬†https://schulichignite.com¬†for example in a browser, here are some caches we¬†might¬†run into:\n\nYour OS cache for DNS; DNS is the system that turns domain names (like schulichignite.com) into something useful for your computer (IP address). Your operating system will typically have an internal cache for common DNS entries (google, microsoft etc.). Likewise there will be some caching as part of your home network and how you connect to the internet.\nYour browser cache; Next as your browser is making the request it might use the¬†browser‚Äôs¬†DNS cache to see if you‚Äôve visited the domain before, and will use the stored value instead. On top of that even if it does go to the DNS it will also check the¬†page cache¬†in your browser to see if you‚Äôve been to the site recently, and if you have to show you a cached copy it stores on your device.\nServer caches; Now assuming you didn‚Äôt get served the page from the browser‚Äôs cache you may find that the server you request the page from has the page stored in one of it‚Äôs caches, or in a CDN. At this point it will return the cached version of the page back to you, and your browser will take the response and cache it so it will load from disk next time.\n\nAt this point just making that one request could be 10‚Äôs to 100‚Äôs of caches that are returning your value. Theoretically speaking you might end up with a request that actually isn‚Äôt processed at all with the typical code and the whole experience is just retrieved from a cache!\nIssues With Caches ¬ß\nWe‚Äôve talked about adding to caches, but the big problem with caches is¬†cache invalidation. We‚Äôre fundamentally storing data about a thing in the assumption that the data should stay the same, and therefore only needs to be checked once. The problem with this is that data doesn‚Äôt stay the same. People change their name on their profile, they update their picture etc. and if everything is cached forever, then those updates aren‚Äôt possible.\nCache invalidation is an incredibly hard problem:\n\nThere are only two hard things in computer science: cache invalidation and naming things. - Phil Karlton\n\nThe question is basically ‚ÄúHow much of the data we‚Äôre guessing will be useful later should we be keeping around, and for how long is it useful?‚Äù. One of the most common solutions is to pick a cap, for example only cache 200 pieces of user info at a time, or limit it to only X number of Mb of data etc.\nOne incredibly common option in webdev is TTL (time to live), which is often set to something like 10 mins. This means for each user the caches on their system are valid for 10 mins, then they are¬†all¬†purged and remade.\nAnother common problem where you can run into issues is when¬†you think you‚Äôre clearing your cache properly, and aren‚Äôt.\nIn fact the common joke about turning a computer system on and off again largely comes from caches. Often times programs store things in memory, which on your system is then stored in RAM. RAM will automatically purge it‚Äôs entire cache when it loses power. This is why turning computers off and on again is sometimes handy!\nCache Invalidation Strategies ¬ß\nThere are tons of cache invalidation strategies you can use to make sure your data is correct, while still getting some of the performance benefits of caching. There‚Äôs not enough time to cover them all, and you will likely on most projects want to employ more than one of these, but here are a few approaches.\nFixed-length ¬ß\nEssentially this system is what we‚Äôve been talking about all this time, except we get rid of items when the cache reaches a certain size. This can be very important in systems with limited resources. You essentially just check if the cache has more items than a set threshold, and if it does you can either do:\n\nFIFO (Queue): First in First out, essentially you delete the oldest items first as you go\nLIFO (Stack): Last in First out, This means you delete the newest items first as you go\n\nDepending on what you need. Keep in mind that some of the data types (maps, dictionaries etc.) in languages are¬†unordered. This means deleting the ‚Äúfirst‚Äù key might be just deleting the first key alphabetically, or randomly, not necessarily the first key entered.\nTime-based/TTL ¬ß\nWe already talked about TTL (time to live), this basically says ‚ÄúHey this cache is valid for the next X mins/hours/days‚Äù. When people make a request the server will check if the current date &amp; time are¬†before¬†the expiry, and if they are after they will update the cache. It might look something like this:\nflowchart TD\n    A[User] --&gt;|Request site| B(Server)\n    B --&gt; C{See if current time &gt;= expiry}\n    C --&gt;|No| D[Cache]\n    D --&gt;|Return stored result to user| A\n    C --&gt;|Yes| E{Cache is invalid}\n    E --Request data then update cache &amp; expiry--&gt;D\n\nWith our earlier code, we could update it to expire after 10 mins:\njs\nconst users = new Map(); // Store results of user queries\n \nfunction getUser(userID){\n    if (!users.has(userID)){ // New ID\n        // Connect and get database object\n        db = database.connect(); \n        // Query for user\n        data = db.get(&quot;user&quot;, userID);\n        // Store data for next time\n        userData = new Map();\n        userData.set(&quot;data&quot;, data)\n \n        // Set expiry\n        const MINUTESTOMILISECONDS = 60000\n        // NOTE: To add 10 mins you need to add 10 mins worth of miliseconds\n        tenMinsFromNow = new Date(Date.now() + (10* MINUTESTOMILISECONDS))\n        userData.set(&quot;expiry&quot;, tenMinsFromNow)\n \n        users.set(userID, userData)\n        return userData.get(&quot;data&quot;)\n    } else{\n            //Check if cache is valid\n            if (Date.now()&gt; users.get(userID).get(&quot;expiry&quot;)){ \n                // Connect and get database object\n                db = database.connect(); \n                // Query for user\n                data = db.get(&quot;user&quot;, userID);\n                // Store data for next time\n                userData = new Map();\n                userData.set(&quot;data&quot;, data)\n \n                // Set expiry\n                const MINUTESTOMILISECONDS = 60000\n                // NOTE: To add 10 mins you need to add 10 mins worth of miliseconds\n                tenMinsFromNow = new Date(Date.now() + (10* MINUTESTOMILISECONDS)) \n                userData.set(&quot;expiry&quot;, tenMinsFromNow)\n \n                users.set(userID, userData)\n            }\n        return users.get(userID).get(&quot;data&quot;)\n    }\n}\n \npython\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n \nusers = dict() # Store results of user queries\n \ndef get_user(user_id: int):\n    user_data = users.get(user_id, False)\n    if not user_data: # New user ID\n        # Connect and get database object\n        db = database.connect() \n        # Query for user\n        data = db.get(&quot;user&quot;, user_id)\n        # Store for next time\n        users[user_id] = {&quot;data&quot;:data, &quot;expiry&quot;: datetime.now()+timedelta(minutes=10)}\n        return users[user_id][&quot;data&quot;]\n    else:\n        if datetime.now() &gt; users[user_id][&quot;expiry&quot;]: # Check if cache is valid\n            # Connect and get database object\n            db = database.connect() \n            # Query for user\n            data = db.get(&quot;user&quot;, user_id)\n            # Store for next time\n            users[user_id] = {&quot;data&quot;:data, &quot;expiry&quot;: datetime.now()+timedelta(minutes=10)}\n        return users[user_id][&quot;data&quot;]\n \nYou can also use this for pre-fetching data. For example maybe you have users across the world, and you know people will use your service at 6pm¬†IN THEIR TIMEZONE, so you can clear and fill your cache with people in different regions at 5:55pm their time. This can help mitigate outages if your system can‚Äôt handle the load of people all trying to call the function at the same time!\nThis approach is ‚Äúeasy‚Äù to implement, but it comes with a ton of problems:\n\nTime is relative;¬†This isn‚Äôt a physics rant, time is literally relative around the world. Daylight savings, timezones etc. Not everyone‚Äôs 5pm is the same 5pm, even every persons hour is not the same. In lots of situations if you set a cache to expire in 10 mins, then daylight savings happens the cache might not invalidate for an hour longer than you were expecting!\nMoving pieces are hard to track;¬†Usually your system won‚Äôt have one function being called. Lots of stuff happens at different times. Not every user is going to update their profile picture at your exact 10 min interval. This doesn‚Äôt matter a lot of the time, but for something time sensitive (like concert tickets going on sale), this can cause issues.\nCrystal balls aren‚Äôt very helpful;¬†While lots of people are predictable, not every situation is. Let‚Äôs say you have the time based pre-fetching system in place, and you‚Äôre a movie streaming service. But then the global launch of a popular movie is at 3am in a country. You will end up with a massive load of traffic from that country at a time you weren‚Äôt expecting, and your caches won‚Äôt help you.\n\nAll of these problems are present in the above example. There will actually be several bugs if you use the code provided. In python you can use timezone packages like¬†pytz¬†to avoid some of the problems, and in javascript¬†spacetime¬†has similar functionality.\nUpdate/Push-based ¬ß\nThis method is essentially updating the cache when there is new data. This means you essentially ‚Äúsubscribe‚Äù to any changes. Here might be an example:\njs\nconst users = new Map(); // Store results of user queries\n \nfunction updateUser(user_id, data){\n    // Connect and get database object\n    db = database.connect() \n    // Store data in DB\n    db.store(&quot;user&quot;, user_id, data) \n    if (users.has(userID)){ // Exists in cache\n        // Update cache\n        users.set(userID, data)\n    }\n \n}\n \nfunction getUser(userID){\n    if (!users.has(userID)){ // New ID\n        // Connect and get database object\n        db = database.connect(); \n        // Query for user\n        data = db.get(&quot;user&quot;, userID);\n        // Store data for next time\n        users.set(userID, data)\n        return data\n    } else{\n        return users.get(userID)\n    }\n}\n \npython\nusers = dict() # Store results of user queries\n \ndef update_user(user_id: int, data: dict):\n    # Connect and get database object\n    db = database.connect() \n    # Store data in DB\n    db.store(&quot;user&quot;, user_id, data) \n \n    # Update cache\n    user_data = users.get(user_id, False)\n    if user_data: # Exists in cache\n        users[user_id] = data \n \n \ndef get_user(user_id: int):\n    user_data = users.get(user_id, False)\n    if not user_data: # New user ID\n        # Connect and get database object\n        db = database.connect() \n        # Query for user\n        data = db.get(&quot;user&quot;, user_id)\n        # Store for next time\n        users[user_id] = data \n        return data\n    else:\n        return user_data\n \nEvent Based ¬ß\nSometimes changes happen on very regular schedules. For these sorts of changes you can have the cache invalidation happen only after a threshold event. For example you only have to update a cached list of results of games in a soccer tournament¬†after each game. So you can have the cache be updated when the game has officially been ended and called by the referee.\nResources ¬ß\n\nHardware\n\nCache Memory Explained - YouTube\nSSDs vs Hard Drives as Fast As Possible (youtube.com)\n\n\nCaching systems\n\nValkey\nVarnish HTTP Cache ‚Äî Varnish HTTP Cache (varnish-cache.org)\n\n\nCache Systems Every Developer Should Know (youtube.com)\nIntroduction to Cache Memory (youtube.com)\nCache Memory 1: Introduction (youtube.com)\nCaching Strategies and How to Choose the Right One | CodeAhoy\nCaching Strategies - 5 Strategies for Managing Cache Space (hazelcast.com)\nCaching patterns - Database Caching Strategies Using Redis (amazon.com)\nCache Strategies | Medium\nNetwork-level CDN\n\nWhat Is A CDN?

Whether it‚Äôs memory on someone‚Äôs computer that needs to be preserved to keep it running, or space on a drive to keep it from being full. Compression is the act of taking some sort of data and storing it in a form that takes up less space than the original form. Usually this is done by finding out what patterns in the data repeat, and then finding ways to represent those repetitions in more compact forms. Compression can be done in tons of clever ways for various different types of data, but an incredibly common form is text compression.\nEncoding as compression ¬ß\nSome people consider some forms of¬†Encodings¬†to be compression. This is a reasonable perspective, in fact many forms of encodings are designed specifically to support compression (such as JPEG).\nText ¬ß\nFor text generally speaking you can look for common patterns and then replace them in the text to make it shorter. For example:\n\nSince each character is roughly 1 byte, we saved 13 bytes.\nImages ¬ß\nImages are another common format that requires compression. With images however there are 2 primary types lossless and lossy.\nLossless ¬ß\nLossless formats are what we‚Äôre used to. They take in some data, compress it, and at the end you can decompress it to get back exactly the data you put in. This is handy for things like text (you usually don‚Äôt want just¬†some¬†of a text file), or images that need high fidelity. PNG is a format that is a lossless form of compression.\nLossy ¬ß\nLossy is unlike the systems we‚Äôve seen before. With typical compression we want to get back¬†exactly¬†what we had before we compressed it. With lossy compression we want to be ‚Äúclose‚Äù. Imagine you have a large image on a small screen, let‚Äôs say a 1920x1080px image on a 480x720p screen. If we were to resize the image and in the process remove 1/8 of the pixels and just stich together a smaller but ‚Äúclose enough‚Äù version of the image, most people wouldn‚Äôt notice.\nFormats like JPG are lossy. They basically create versions of images that are ‚Äúclose enough‚Äù to the original source images. This can cause some issues like¬†artifacts, a good quick explainer about this can be found¬†here as a video\nBase 64 ¬ß\nThere are multiple different number systems that exist. For the most part people use base 10, which is where numbers go from 0-9, then you add a digit, and then each successive digit is a multiple of 10 (100, 1000, etc.).\nThere are several other number systems used in computer science. Base 2 is where you go from 0-1 and then shift up a digit where each digit is a power of 2 (i.e. 0001 is 1, 0010 is 2, 0100 is 4, 1000 is 8 etc.). Or hex which is base 16 where you go from 0-9 then letters A-F.\nOne other interesting number system we use is base 64. The reason base 64 is handy is because it gives you short text representations for lots of data. This is why in many database systems images are not stored as images. The metadata is stored elsewhere for each image, and the images themselves are stores by taking all the data that makes up the pixels and converting it to base64.\nFor example if we take the¬†5x5 version¬†of this image:\n\nCan be stored as:\ndata:image/jpeg;base64,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\nWith this text representation the text can now be further compressed\nVideos &amp; Audio ¬ß\nText and images are important, and should be compressed since it‚Äôs wasteful not to, however videos and audio are some of the largest files you will encounter on devices. This is because inherently the quality is tied to file size. The greater the quality of video and audio the more you need to sample.\nSampling ¬ß\nSampling is basically the frequency you measure at. Obviously when videos and audio is created it needs to be recorded, and in order to record the camera and/or microphone needs to know how quickly it should be capturing information. With Video this is usually in fps (frames per second) where you tell the camera to record for example 30 frames per second (1 frame of video captured every ~33 miliseconds!).\nAudio is sampled even more agressively than video, typically it‚Äôs sampled in kHz, and usually ~48kHz (48,000 samples/second or 1 sample per ~28 microseconds which is 1,000,000 smaller than a second).\nThe cost of sampling ¬ß\nSo uncompressed if we took a 720p video (1280x720 pixels or 921,600 pixels) at 30fps, using RGB colours (3 8 bit numbers representing the amount of red, green, blue in a frame), and 44.1kHz audio at¬†16-bit depth¬†(1,411,200 bits per second) then per second we are storing ~ 83.12 megaBytes per second:\nAudio + video = total per second\n \n(44,100 samples x 16 bits per sample x 2 channels / 8 bits per byte) + (921,600 pixels * 3 bytes per pixel * 30 frames per second) = total per second\n \n(176,400 bytes) + (82,944,000 bytes) = 83,120,400 bytes/second \n \n83,120,400 bytes per second / 1000 bytes per kiloByte / 1000 kiloBytes per megaByte = 83.12 MegaBytes per second\nThat might not sound like a lot, but for a 1 minute video that‚Äôs 4.987 Gigabytes or 2.9922 TeraBytes per hour. So if you had a shop with some security cameras and you wanted to record in 720p with 44.1kHz 16-bit audio you would end up with 71.8128 TeraBytes per day, or 26.211672 PetaBytes a year. If we were to buy the largest drive I found on memory express (this one) it‚Äôs about $30/TeraByte, so for a day it would cost $2,127 and for a year it would be ~$786,350.16. This would never be sustainable for video hosting services. To put this in perspective there‚Äôs 8760 hours per year, and YouTube has¬†271,330 hours per¬†day¬†being uploaded (~$24 million a day, or ~$9 billion a year). So how do we make these smaller?\nCodecs ¬ß\nCodecs are the name given to the systems that are used to encode and decode video files. There are tons of codecs, and tons of variants of codecs that substitute different parts of the compression -&gt; encoding -&gt; decoding pipeline\nSome common codecs are:\n\nMPEG\nH.264/AVC\nHEVC\nAV1\n\nWhy not compress everything? ¬ß\nMost things these days are compressed, but you might not always want compression. Compression helps save space, this can be important where space is limited, or where the amount of information sent matters (i.e. over a network). But, this does comes with a few potential tradeoffs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsConsSaves spaceCompression algorithms can be intense and take a while to computeCan be faster to load over a networkSince it‚Äôs a special format you need a program to decompress it which can take time and lots of resources\nSo if you have an incredibly weak computer, but a lot of storage, it might be worth trading off the loss of storage space for less computing power needed.

This means it runs from top to bottom, and it runs one line at a time. There are various different ways that we can break this paradigm and run our code ‚Äúmultiple lines‚Äù at a time. There are 4 main ways this is discussed:\n\nAsynchronous programming\nParallel programming\nMulti-processing\nMulti-Threading\n\nUnfortunately these terms can mean something different in different contexts, so instead I will talk about 2 more general categories asynchronous vs parallel.\nAsync/Await ¬ß\nAsynchronous execution (which I‚Äôll shorten to async), is a way of running a program where you can switch back and forth between tasks that are executing (concurrent programming). For example if you have a function that has to access a database, but other operations can run while you‚Äôre waiting for that to finish, then you could asynchronously call the database, and run the other tasks in the meantime. Once the database call is finished, you can switch back to the method running the database call. With the following pseudocode:\nasync function getData(){\n\treturn callToDatabase() // Takes a while to run\n}\n\nasync function doBackgroundTasks(){\n\t// Do stuff in the background\n}\n\nfunction main(){\n\ta = getData()\n\tdoBackgroundTasks()\n\t// Wait for a to finish if it&#039;s still not done after background tasks\n\tawait a \n}\n\nIn this case we have 2 keywords:\n\nasync: Used to declare a function as asynchronous\nawait: Used to make the program stop and wait for an asynchronous function to finish\n\n*Please note I represented main() as a synchronous function, some runtimes will still require you to declare it as an async function, and await it somehow\nIf we were to look at a diagram of how this would execute it would be something like this:\n1200\nHowever it‚Äôs also possible to have:\n1200\nIn this case getData() finished early, so when await is called it‚Äôs already done and execution continues. The most complicated parts of asynchronous programming are that things can run out-of-order. This is a benefit in terms of performance, but can often lead to bugs (such as those discussed in Dining Philosophers).\nHere is an example in python:\nimport random\nimport asyncio # Used to make managing async functions easier\n \nasync def get_data():\n    print(&quot;get_data() running&quot;)\n    await asyncio.sleep(random.randint(1,15))\n    print(&quot;get_data() done&quot;)\n    return &quot;data&quot;\n \nasync def do_background_tasks():\n    print(&quot;do_background_tasks() running&quot;)\n    ... # Do stuff in the background\n    print(&quot;do_background_tasks() done&quot;)\n \nasync def main():\n    # A TaskGroup is an easy way to start multiple async functions\n    async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as tg:\n        a = tg.create_task(get_data())\n        tg.create_task(do_background_tasks())\n    \n    print(a.result())\n \nif __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:\n    asyncio.run(main())\nWhich prints:\nget_data() running\ndo_background_tasks() running\ndo_background_tasks() done\nget_data() done\ndata\n\nMultiprocessing ¬ß\nWhen your operating system starts an application it will setup a process. This process is the running version of the application. As such, one method of parallelism that exists is to run multiple processes. This is often a good choice if you want the tasks not just to run more efficiently, but if there are external time factors that mean you must run them simultaneously.\nIf you imagine for example you write an application that is an automated scraper to purchase tickets to a concert. Let‚Äôs say you want to buy 5 tickets, and you have 10 seconds before they sell out. With threads you would switch back and forth between each thread, so if each thread takes a while to startup, you may miss your window. Instead if you launch 5 separate processes, they all can run on separate cores on a machine, and run simultaneously. Please keep in mind that not all things in computing that are called multiprocessing work this way. Sometimes multiple processes can end up running on the same core, and at that point it‚Äôs no better than threading (arguably worse since it uses more resources than threads).\nHere is an example of multiprocessing in python (please note that since each process is a separate python instance it is possible for this to run in parallel or concurrently depending on architecture):\nfrom multiprocessing import Process\nimport time\nimport random\n \ndef task(identifier: int):\n    print(f&quot;Started #{identifier} at {time.ctime()}&quot;)\n    time.sleep(random.randint(0,10))\n    print(f&quot;Ended #{identifier} at {time.ctime()}&quot;)\n    \n \nif __name__ == &#039;__main__&#039;:\n    processes = []\n    for index in range(10):\n        process = Process(target=task, args=(index,))\n        process.start()\n        processes.append(process)\n \n    for process in processes:\n        process.join()\nSince they all run at the same time they can finish in any order. For example here is what I got:\nStarted #0 at Tue Dec 10 03:28:47 2024\nStarted #1 at Tue Dec 10 03:28:47 2024\nStarted #2 at Tue Dec 10 03:28:47 2024\nStarted #3 at Tue Dec 10 03:28:47 2024\nStarted #4 at Tue Dec 10 03:28:47 2024\nStarted #5 at Tue Dec 10 03:28:47 2024\nStarted #6 at Tue Dec 10 03:28:47 2024\nStarted #7 at Tue Dec 10 03:28:47 2024\nStarted #8 at Tue Dec 10 03:28:47 2024\nStarted #9 at Tue Dec 10 03:28:47 2024\nEnded #4 at Tue Dec 10 03:28:48 2024\nEnded #3 at Tue Dec 10 03:28:49 2024\nEnded #0 at Tue Dec 10 03:28:50 2024\nEnded #2 at Tue Dec 10 03:28:51 2024\nEnded #5 at Tue Dec 10 03:28:52 2024\nEnded #6 at Tue Dec 10 03:28:53 2024\nEnded #7 at Tue Dec 10 03:28:53 2024\nEnded #8 at Tue Dec 10 03:28:54 2024\nEnded #9 at Tue Dec 10 03:28:55 2024\nEnded #1 at Tue Dec 10 03:28:57 2024\n\nThreading ¬ß\nMulti-threading is a technique in which you create multiple ‚Äúthreads‚Äù. A ‚Äúthread‚Äù is a separated area inside a process that lets you run code. There are two types of threads:\n\nOS threads: This is a heavy weight type of thread that is created in the operating system Kernel, and managed by it\nGreen/virtual Threads: These are ‚Äúthreads‚Äù that are much more lightweight and are managed in user space, typically by the language they are implemented in\n\nFor the most part in modern programming green/virtual threads are used, and so that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll discuss here. In many implementations threads are essentially a second copy of a program that will run until some sort of ‚Äúyield‚Äù point, at which point they will let another thread run. These yield points can be implemented various ways, such as with hardcoded time-slots, or more controllable implementations like ‚Äúinterrupts‚Äù (i.e. switch when doing I/O like opening a file). There are a few different approaches to creating threads, and thread management. For creating threads there are 2 main common approaches.\nstart() and join() ¬ß\nThe first is to manage threads individually. For example you pass the thread a callback function (something to run), with it‚Äôs arguments, and then start() the thread. From there you let it run, and join() the thread to wait for it to end. For example lets say you have an app where you select a bunch of files to download, then you have to digitally ‚Äúsign‚Äù with your information to confirm you downloaded the files. Let‚Äôs say you need to get the URL‚Äôs for each file before you can download them. You could do something like:\nfunction getFileURLs(filenames: list[str]){\n\tresult = []\n\tfor file in filenames{\n\t\tfileURL = getURLbyFilename(file)\n\t\tresult.add(fileURL)\n\t}\n}\n\nfunction downloadFiles(fileURLs:list[str]){\n\tfor url in fileURLs{\n\t\tdownload(url)\n\t}\n}\n\nfunction sign(name:str, token:str) -&gt; bool{\n\tisValid = signForDocment(name, token)\n\treturn isValid\n}\n\nfunction main(){\n\tfilenames = [&quot;file1.png&quot;, &quot;file2.jpg&quot;, &quot;file3.docx&quot;]\n\tthread = Thread(callback=getFileURLs, arguments = [filenames])\n\n\tthread.start()\n\t// Can ask the user for their name and token while getting the URL&#039;s\n\tname = askUserforName()\n\ttoken = getTokenByName(name)\n\t \n\tvalid = sign(name, token)\n\t\n\tif valid{\n\t\tresult = thread.join()\n\t\tdownloadFiles(result)\n\t} else{\n\t\terror(&quot;Unable to sign for files&quot;)\n\t}\n}\n\nHere is an example of this code in python:\nimport threading\nimport random\nimport time\nfrom typing import List\nimport uuid\n \ndef download(filename:str) -&gt; bool:\n    print(&quot;inside download()&quot;)\n    time.sleep(random.randint(0,1))\n    print(&quot;Finishing download()&quot;)\n    return random.choice([True, False])\n \ndef sign_for_docment(name:str, token:str) -&gt; bool:\n    print(&quot;inside sign_for_docment()&quot;)\n    time.sleep(random.randint(0,1))\n    print(&quot;Finishing sign_for_docment()&quot;)\n    return random.choice([True, False])\n \ndef get_file_urls(filenames:List[str], result:List[str]) -&gt; List[str]:\n    print(&quot;inside get_file_urls()&quot;)\n    time.sleep(random.randint(4,15))\n    for file in filenames:\n        result.append(f&quot;/path/to/{file}&quot;)\n    print(&quot;Finishing get_file_urls()&quot;)\n    return result\n \ndef download_files(fileURLs:list[str]):\n    print(&quot;inside download_files()&quot;)\n    for url in fileURLs:\n        download(url)\n    print(&quot;Finishing download_files()&quot;)\n \ndef sign(name:str, token:str) -&gt; bool:\n    print(&quot;inside sign()&quot;)\n    isValid = sign_for_docment(name, token)\n    print(&quot;Finishing sign()&quot;)\n    return isValid\n \ndef ask_user_for_name() -&gt;str:\n    print(&quot;inside ask_user_for_name()&quot;)\n    print(&quot;Finishing ask_user_for_name()&quot;)\n    return &quot;name&quot;\n    \ndef get_token_by_name(name:str) -&gt; str:\n    print(&quot;inside get_token_by_name()&quot;)\n    print(&quot;Finishing get_token_by_name()&quot;)\n    return str(uuid.uuid4())\n    \nif __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:\n    filenames = [&quot;file1.png&quot;, &quot;file2.jpg&quot;, &quot;file3.docx&quot;]\n    result = []\n    thread = threading.Thread(target=get_file_urls, args=(filenames,result))\n    thread.start()\n    print(&quot;thread is running!&quot;)\n    name = ask_user_for_name()\n    token = get_token_by_name(name)\n    valid = sign(name, token)\n    if valid:\n        thread.join()\n        print(&quot;thread is done!&quot;)\n        download_files(result)\n    else:\n        raise Exception(&quot;Unable to sign for files&quot;)\n \nThread Manager ¬ß\nIn every language there are various thread managers. Thread managers (often called executors or pools) are systems that help you run threads and manage them more easily. In python there are several thread managers, a common one is ThreadPoolExecutor. This can be used to run a ton of tasks much more simply without having to explicitly start() and join() each thread:\nimport time\nimport random\nimport concurrent.futures\n \ndef task(identifier:int):\n    print(f&quot;inside task() #{identifier}&quot;)\n    time.sleep(random.randint(0,10))\n    print(f&quot;done task() #{identifier}&quot;)\n \nwith concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as pool:\n    for index in range(20):\n        pool.submit(task, index)\nWhich prints something like:\ninside task() #0\ninside task() #1\ninside task() #2\ndone task() #2\ninside task() #3\ninside task() #4\ndone task() #1\ninside task() #5\ndone task() #0\ninside task() #6\ndone task() #5\ninside task() #7\ndone task() #4\ninside task() #8\ndone task() #7\ninside task() #9\ndone task() #3\ninside task() #10\ndone task() #6\ninside task() #11\ndone task() #11\ninside task() #12\ndone task() #12\ninside task() #13\ndone task() #10\ninside task() #14\ndone task() #9\ninside task() #15\ndone task() #15\ninside task() #16\ndone task() #8\ninside task() #17\ndone task() #16\ninside task() #18\ndone task() #13\ninside task() #19\ndone task() #17\ndone task() #14\ndone task() #18\ndone task() #19\n\nConcurrency vs Parallelism ¬ß\nConcurrent execution is just switching back and forth between threads/processes, whereas parallel execution is when multiple threads/processes are running at the same time. In order for something to be parallel there needs to be support at a hardware level. Additionally parallelism tends to take more resources, and is harder to synchronize. For example a system with multiple processor cores for separate processes to run in.\n1200\nSynchronization ¬ß\nAccessing variables can become complicated in concurrent and parallel contexts. There a major issue can come up, data races. A data race is when multiple processes try to access and modify shared data. This can lead to the data being corrupted, or just incorrect. As a simple example consider a shopping system that processes payments:\ncurrent_id\n\nfunction increment_id(){\n\tglobal current_id\n\tfor 0..1000{\n\t\tcurrent_id += 1\n\t}\n}\n\nfunction main(){\n\tt1 = thread(increment_id)\n\tt2 = thread(increment_id)\n\tt3 = thread(increment_id)\n\tt4 = thread(increment_id)\n\t\n\tt1.start()\n\tt2.start()\n\tt3.start()\n\tt4.start()\n\n\tt1.join()\n\tt2.join()\n\tt3.join()\n\tt4.join()\n\t\n\tprint(f&quot;Final counter value: {counter}&quot;)\n}\n\n\nIn python it‚Äôs much harder than other languages to cause a race condition. Python has a mechanism called the GIL that makes it hard to cause one. Instead I modified the counter example with a ‚Äúshared resource‚Äù (a text file). Here is the code:\nimport time\nimport random\nimport threading\n \ndef increment():\n    with open(&quot;counter.txt&quot;) as c:\n        counter = int(c.read())\n        print(f&quot;Opened with count = {counter}&quot;)\n    time.sleep(random.random())\n    for _ in range(1000000):\n        counter += 1\n    with open(&quot;counter.txt&quot;, &quot;w+&quot;) as c:\n        c.write(str(counter))\n    print(f&quot;Closed with count = {counter}&quot;)\n    \nthreads = []\n    \nfor _ in range(15):\n    t = threading.Thread(target=increment)\n    t.start()\n    threads.append(t)\n \nfor t in threads:\n    t.join()\nWith the output:\nOpened with count = 0\nOpened with count = 0\nOpened with count = 0\nOpened with count = 0\nOpened with count = 0\nOpened with count = 0\nOpened with count = 0\nOpened with count = 0\nOpened with count = 0\nOpened with count = 0\nOpened with count = 0\nOpened with count = 0\nOpened with count = 0\nOpened with count = 0\nOpened with count = 0\nClosed with count = 1000000\nClosed with count = 1000000\nClosed with count = 1000000\nClosed with count = 1000000\nClosed with count = 1000000\nClosed with count = 1000000\nClosed with count = 1000000\nClosed with count = 1000000\nClosed with count = 1000000\nClosed with count = 1000000\nClosed with count = 1000000\nClosed with count = 1000000\nClosed with count = 1000000\nClosed with count = 1000000\nClosed with count = 1000000\n\nSynchronization Primitives ¬ß\nWhen programming there are many synchronization primitives, which are tools used to make synchronization possible in concurrent and parallel contexts. This helps avoid data races.\nTerminology ¬ß\nWhen looking at synchronization it‚Äôs worthwhile to know a few terms to be able to understand some of the content:\n\nMutual Exclusion: This is a fancy term to say that only 1 thing can happen at a time. If you have code that is mutually exclusive, then two threads cannot access it simultaneously.\nDeadlocks/Livelocks: When you manage to make your code get stuck, usually because every thread is waiting on a resource that has been permanently locked by accident. A deadlock means there are no operations running in the threads, a livelock is when there are operations running, but the thread can‚Äôt continue\nSections: When talking about code in concurrent/parallel contexts we often break it up into discrete sections\n\nEntry Section: The code that happens before the critical section, essentially the code that runs to setup the critical section, typically this is where any locks are acquired\nCritical section: This refers to a part of the code that accesses a resource that is shared. Essentially this part of the code that does work, and should have a limited number of threads accessing it\nExit section: The code that cleans up after the critical section, this typically is where locks are released\n\n\n\nDining Philosophers ¬ß\nAvoiding data races is important, but another problem comes up depending on your solution, Deadlocks/Livelocks. This is when you implement a synchronization system that makes it possible to get ‚Äústuck‚Äù (locked). As an example imagine table where there are philosophers sitting at a table. The philosophers can either think() or eat(). When philosophers want to eat() they must pick up a chopstick on the right, and left hand side of them:\nfunction think(){\n\t... // think \n}\n\nfunction eat(){\n\twhile not both_copsticks:\n\t\tif is_available(right_chopstick) and not_in_hand(right_chopstick):\n\t\t\tpickup_chopstick(left_chopstick)\n\t\tif is_available(left_chopstick) and not_in_hand(left_chopstick):\n\t\t\tpickup_chopstick(left_chopstick)\n\teat_food()\n\tput_down_chopsticks(left_chopstick, right_chopstick)\n}\n\nLets say you have a table of 6 philosophers, and 6 chopsticks. It is possible to have a situation where every chopstick is picked up, but no one can eat(), meaning they all get stuck in a loop waiting for another chopstick. This stuck state is called a deadlock:\n1200\nIf each philosopher enters eat() at the same time, they will pick up the chopstick to their right, and be endlessly stuck waiting for the left chopstick, which will never be available. This analogy can apply to any shared resource.\nMutex ¬ß\nA mutex (or spinlock) is a synchronization primitive that allows threads/processes to acquire() (or lock()) and release() (or unlock()) it. You can imagine this like being given a key to enter. When you acquire() the key, you can enter, and then you release() the key back to the next person who needs it. The most important thing to keep in mind is that for a mutex to work properly, the acquire() must be atomic. This is typically done in hardware, and ensures that it is not possible for two threads to simultaneously acquire(). For example:\ncounter = 0 // Shared resource\n\nfunction increment(){\n\t// Entry section\n\tmutex.acquire() // Wait on mutex\n\t \n\t// Critical section\n\tcounter += 1\n\t\n\t// Exit section\n\tmutex.release()\n}\n\nthreads = []\n\nfor 0..5{\n\tt = Thread(increment)\n\tt.start()\n\tthreads.add(t)\n}\n\nfor thread in threads{\n\tthread.join()\n}\n\n\nHere is that same example in python:\nimport threading\n \n# Shared resource\ncounter = 0\n \n# Create a lock\nmutex = threading.Lock()\n \ndef increment_counter():\n    global counter\n    for _ in range(1000):\n        # Entry Section\n        mutex.acquire() # Acquire the lock before modifying the shared resource\n        try:\n            # Critical Section\n            counter += 1\n        finally:\n            # Exit section\n            mutex.release() # Release the lock\n \n# Create multiple threads\nthreads = []\nfor _ in range(5):  # 5 threads\n    t = threading.Thread(target=increment_counter)\n    threads.append(t)\n    t.start()\n \n# Wait for all threads to complete\nfor t in threads:\n    t.join()\n \nprint(f&quot;Final counter value: {counter}&quot;)\nKeep in mind you can have multiple separate mutexes if you need them.\nCondition Variable ¬ß\nA condition variable is a system to signal to threads and wake them up. This comes up typically in the producer-consumer (or readers-writers) problem, where you have producers that produce data that consumers need to consume (i.e. email clients producing emails that the email server needs to send). In these cases the threads for the consumer spend a lot of time waiting if there is nothing being produced.\nThere are typically two solutions to this:\n\nLong polling: Waiting by making the consumer threads sleep() for a set amount of time, and then checking if they have anything to do\nCondition variables: An efficient system that is used to notify() threads, and wake them up only when they have something to do\n\nA condition variable will have 2 functions typically notify() and wait(). wait() will make the thread sit idle until notify() is called from somewhere else in the code. This is much more efficient than sleeping for a set interval (long polling) for a few reasons:\n\nEven a sleep like 100ms can massively slowdown systems of thousands of threads\nConsumer threads run exactly when they need to, without any wasted time\n\nHere is a long polling example:\nimport threading\nimport time\n \n# Shared data\ndata = []\nmutex = threading.Lock()  # Lock to protect shared data\n \n# Producer function\ndef producer():\n    global data\n    for i in range(5):  # Produce 5 items\n        with mutex:\n            print(f&quot;Producer: Adding item {i}&quot;)\n            data.append(i)  # Produce an item\n        time.sleep(1)  # Simulate time taken to produce\n \n# Consumer function\ndef consumer():\n    global data\n    for _ in range(5):  # Consume 5 items\n        while True:\n            with mutex:\n                if data:  # Check if there&#039;s data to consume\n                    item = data.pop(0)\n                    print(f&quot;Consumer: Consumed item {item}&quot;)\n                    break\n            time.sleep(0.1)  # Wait before checking again (long-polling delay)\n \n# Create and start the threads\nproducer_thread = threading.Thread(target=producer)\nconsumer_thread = threading.Thread(target=consumer)\n \nproducer_thread.start()\nconsumer_thread.start()\n \n# Wait for both threads to complete\nproducer_thread.join()\nconsumer_thread.join()\n \nprint(&quot;All items have been produced and consumed.&quot;)\nYou can see in this example  the consumer is waiting a set amount of time between checking if data is available. Compare this to the condition variable version:\nimport threading\nimport time\n \n# Shared data\ndata = []\ncondition = threading.Condition()\n \n# Producer function\ndef producer():\n    global data\n    for i in range(5):  # Produce 5 items\n        with condition:\n            print(f&quot;Producer: Adding item {i}&quot;)\n            data.append(i)  # Produce an item\n            condition.notify()  # Notify the consumer\n        time.sleep(1)  # Simulate time taken to produce\n \n# Consumer function\ndef consumer():\n    global data\n    for _ in range(5):  # Consume 5 items\n        with condition:\n            while not data:  # Wait until there is data\n                condition.wait()\n            item = data.pop(0)  # Consume the item\n            print(f&quot;Consumer: Consumed item {item}&quot;)\n \n# Create and start the threads\nproducer_thread = threading.Thread(target=producer)\nconsumer_thread = threading.Thread(target=consumer)\n \nproducer_thread.start()\nconsumer_thread.start()\n \n# Wait for both threads to complete\nproducer_thread.join()\nconsumer_thread.join()\n \nprint(&quot;All items have been produced and consumed.&quot;)\nThis is much more efficient because the consumer context manager (with condition inside consumer()), only runs when condition.notify() is called in producer(), otherwise the consumer() thread is doing nothing and wasting no CPU time sleeping.\nSemaphore ¬ß\nA semaphore is similar to a mutex, but it allows for more than 1 thing to access the critical section/shared resource at a time. For example let‚Äôs say you can have up to 3 threads simultaneously accessing a server, you can setup a semaphore with an initial value of 3, and at any given time at most 3 threads will access it.\nSemaphores have various implementations, but in general they have some sort of a value (sometimes called count), which is an integer that indicates how many things can currently access the critical section/shared resource. In these examples I also used a condition variable to wake up threads, but you can also just sleep after the operations (though this can slow down your program a lot, and cause many out-of-order executions). Semaphores have 2 methods, wait() and signal() (sometimes called other things like notify() instead of signal()).\nWait will:\nclass Semaphore{\n\tfunction wait(){\n\t\t// Wait for resource to be available\n\t\twhile self.value &lt;= 0{\n\t\t\tself.condition.wait()\n\t\t}\n\t\tself.value -= 1 // Decrement now you&#039;re allowed access to the resource\n\t}\n}\n\nMeaning you have to sit and wait, until Semaphore.value goes above 0, at which point you‚Äôre allowed in to the critical section/allowed to accessed shared resource, and need to decrement the value as you enter. Now that you‚Äôre done waiting, once finished with the critical section/access you will then signal() to indicate you‚Äôre done:\nclass Semaphore{\n\tfunction signal(){\n\t\tself.value += 1\n\t\tself.condition.notify() // Tell another thread to wake up\n\t}\n}\n\nFor example if you initialize a semaphore with a count of 3, then have 1 thread currently accessing the critical section/resource, you would end up with a count of 2 on the semaphore, until the thread is done.\nimport threading\n \nclass Semaphore:\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\n    Semaphore represents a counting semaphore that controls access to a shared resource.&quot;&quot;&quot;\n    def __init__(self, initial_value:int):\n        &quot;&quot;&quot;Initialize the semaphore with the given initial value\n \n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        initial_value : int\n            The initial value of the semaphore (essentially the capacity)\n        &quot;&quot;&quot;\n        self.value = initial_value\n        self.mutex = threading.Lock()\n        self.condition = threading.Condition(self.mutex)\n \n    def wait(self):\n        &quot;&quot;&quot;Decrement the semaphore value, blocking if it would go below zero&quot;&quot;&quot;\n        with self.condition:\n            while self.value &lt;= 0:\n                self.condition.wait()\n            self.value -= 1  # Decrement semaphore value under mutex protection\n \n    def signal(self):\n        &quot;&quot;&quot;Increment the semaphore value and wake one waiting thread&quot;&quot;&quot;\n        with self.condition:\n            self.value += 1  # Increment semaphore value under mutex protection\n            self.condition.notify()  # Wake up one waiting thread\n*Please note that this semaphore is ‚Äúgenerally‚Äù safe, but I would recommend using [threading.Semaphore()](threading ‚Äî Thread-based parallelism ‚Äî Python 3.13.1 documentation) for any serious code\nYou can then test this out with:\nimport time\n \ndef worker(semaphore, id):\n    print(f&quot;Worker {id} waiting...&quot;)\n    semaphore.wait()\n    print(f&quot;Worker {id} working...&quot;)\n    time.sleep(1)\n    print(f&quot;Worker {id} done.&quot;)\n    semaphore.signal()\n \nsem = Semaphore(2)  # Semaphore with an initial value of 2\n \nthreads = [threading.Thread(target=worker, args=(sem, index)) for index in range(50)]\n \nfor thread in threads: # Start threads\n    thread.start()\n \nfor thread in threads: # Wait for them all to finish\n    thread.join()\nYou will watch the threads run 2 at a time:\nWorker 0 waiting...\nWorker 0 working...\nWorker 1 waiting...\nWorker 1 working...\n... // rest of workers waiting\nWorker 48 waiting...\nWorker 49 waiting...\nWorker 0 done.\nWorker 1 done.\nWorker 2 working...\nWorker 3 working...\nWorker 2 done.\nWorker 3 done.\nWorker 4 working...\nWorker 5 working...\n... // Rest of workers taking turns\nWorker 46 done.\nWorker 47 done.\nWorker 48 working...\nWorker 49 working...\nWorker 48 done.\nWorker 49 done.\n\nAdditional Resources ¬ß\n\nDining philosophers\n\nDining Philosopher Problem Using Semaphores - GeeksforGeeks\nSolutions\n\nPeterson‚Äôs Algorithm\n\nPeterson‚Äôs Algorithm in Process Synchronization - GeeksforGeeks\nPeterson‚Äôs Solution\nPeterson‚Äôs Solution-Critical Section Problem-Operating Systems-20A05402T\n\n\nSynchronization\n\nThe Volatile and Synchronized Keywords in Java | Atomic Variables | Java Multithreading | Geekific\nMutex\n\nhow does a Mutex even work?

You can imagine the same concept (a boat, a sandwhich etc.) being encoded in different languages (spanish, english etc.). But in computer science most often when people are talking about encoding they are talking about text &amp; file encoders.\nWhy Encode? ¬ß\nEncoding often provides a universal language that can be spoken between systems. Imagine you‚Äôre a ship at sea, everyone on the ocean speaks a different human language (english, spanish etc.). How can you comunicate in a language-agnostic way about your position so that the boats don‚Äôt collide?\nWell, if we decide on a system, like say the latitude, then longitude, then bearing (North, South, East, West), then no matter the language you only need to communicate that message for everyone to understand.\nSome encoding schemes have other advantages like:\n\nCryptographic security (A way of authenticating messages/files sent)\nEfficiency (In terms of space files/messages take up)\nEnabling large character sets\netc.\n\nLookup-Based encodings ¬ß\nLookup based encodings use some sort of collection to provide a mapping of keys-&gt; values. This could be a number representing a letter, or even a word. Whatever the semantics the idea is that you start with a certain input, run it through an encoding, and then have some way to take the encoding and convert it back to the input text!\nText &amp; File encoders ¬ß\nThe most common use for lookup-based encoders is text and file encoding. Every file you open, every webpage you look at, all of them will have a certain encoding to the file that facilitates the text you see on screen.\nASCII ¬ß\nASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is one of the simplest of the text encoding systems. Essentially it‚Äôs used to map integers to characters. It has 255 values (in the extended version, 128 in the original), which allows it to represent 255 characters using only numbers. A full table can be found here, but for example we could do a simple python implementation with a subset of the ascii characters:\nASCII_TABLE ={ # This would normally have all 128 or 256 values\n  &quot;h&quot;:104,\n  &quot;e&quot;:101,\n  &quot;l&quot;:108,\n  &quot;o&quot;:111\n}\n \nword = &quot;hello&quot;\nresult = []\nfor letter in word:\n  result.append(ASCII_TABLE[letter])\nprint(result) # [104, 101, 108, 108, 111]\nDocuments used to commonly use ascii because each character is guaranteed to be at most 1 byte (8 bits, since 8 bits can represent 256 values). This made early networking code simpler because you could read files 1 byte at a time and be guaranteed 1 letter!\nUFT-8 ¬ß\nUTF-8 Is a more modern version of ASCII. IT is quite a bit larger and more complicated (can represent 1,112,064 valid character). The first 128 characters of UTF-8 are ASCII compatible. UTF-8 is usually the standard for most text editors, webpages, and text files.\nPros\n\nLarger character set (turns out there‚Äôs a world beyond English)\nSelf-Synchronizing\n\nCons\n\nMore complicated to implement (more characters)\nSupport for weirder cases (some emojis are literally two characters added)\n\nOther Types of Encodings ¬ß\nAs I said, encodings are just a way to represent information from one form to another. This means there‚Äôs more than just 1-1 lookup encodings. Any standardized string representations of data can be considered an encoding.\nShip encoding from before ¬ß\nEarlier we talked about the example of having a way to tell other ships about your location and the way you‚Äôre headed to avoid collisions. Let‚Äôs update our information we need to include:\n\nCurrent location (Longitude, Latitude)\nCurrent bearing (North, South, East, West and any combination of two of those)\nCurrent speed (m/s)\n\nTo do this we can provide the encoding format:\nlong|lat|bearing|speed\nWhere longitude and latitude are floating points to 3 decimal places, can be negative or positive, and up to 3 digit numbers (i.e. 0.0 to 999.999). So for example:\n44.810|-166.782|NE|11\nWould be someone Moving north east at 11m/s, at the location (44.810,-166.782). This encoding means that if each character is a byte, we can encode any boat location in the world in 23 bytes! If there are 500,000 boats in the world we could track them all using 11.5Mb of data!\nProgramming languages as encodings ¬ß\nMany people call programming languages encodings for the underlying ‚Äúidea‚Äù of a system. Even more common of a comparison is markup languages like HTML are an encoding for how you want something to look. It‚Äôs text that uses elements to ‚Äúrepresent‚Äù a visual interface!\nSanitization ¬ß\nHaving these lookup systems is great, but what happens when someone does something invalid? What happens in ASCII if someone puts 512 bits? What happens if someone includes a character that‚Äôs outside your character set? These questions are all questions of sanitization.\nSanitization is essentially the process of cleaning data to make sure it‚Äôs safe before using it for anything. This can be raising errors and stopping execution for invalid encoded information, or stripping invalid information. You can find more information here.\nAdditional Resources ¬ß\n\nThe power of paths | Schulich Ignite\nUnicode, in friendly terms: ASCII, UTF-8, code points, character encodings, and more (youtube.com)\nASCII, Unicode, UTF-8: Explained Simply (youtube.com)\nCharacters, Symbols and the Unicode Miracle - Computerphile (youtube.com)\nWhat are UTF-8 and UTF-16?

This output data should be deterministic, meaning for each input there should be 1 output when put through our hashing algorithm. Also it should be 1-way, meaning unlike encryption or compression where we want to be able to get the original value for hashing we only want to create an output from an input, but we do not want to be able to get the input from the output. Ideally in most cases you also want something that returns a fixed-size output, so no matter how big your input is you always get the same length output.\nSo to recap hash functions should:\n\nHave 1 output for each input (deterministic) and ideally unique (see hash collisions)\nAble to get output from input, but not input from output (one-way)\nShould return outputs of the same length (Fixed-size output); Not required but nice to have\n\nSo let‚Äôs say we have a hashing algorithm called hash(). When we call hash() with the text kieran (hash(&quot;kieran)) we get back the hash 3617183895572154872. The important thing is that when we call hash(&quot;kieran&quot;) again we should get 3617183895572154872 again. In other words for the same input, we should always get the same output, and ideally the output for each input should be unique.\nUses ¬ß\nThere are far too many uses for hashes to cover them all here (blockchains, git/vcs, cache invalidation etc.), but I have included a few common ones.\nIntegrity Hashes ¬ß\nWhen you‚Äôre downloading a file from the internet you are fundamentally getting it from a network. How do you know that someone has not replaced the original file in transit to your device? How do you know the image your downloading isn‚Äôt actually some malicious code? One way to check is with integrity hashes.\nIntegrity hashes have been around for a while, on the early days of the internet md5 file hashes were common to see on websites you donwloaded software from. Even though security has gotten better since the 2000‚Äôs it‚Äôs still a concerning prospect that you might be downloading unsafe files. The most concerning of these are files you don‚Äôt even choose to download.\nWhen you run javascript on a webpage you often first have to download the file from somewhere. Typically this is done by including a URL in the src attribute of a script tag. Let‚Äôs say for example our file is hosted on https://schulichignite.com/file.js we could do:\n&lt;script src=&quot;https://schulichignite.com/file.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\nWell, if we put on our hacking black fedora‚Äôs and trench-coats there is a clear way for someone malicious to inject code into this. All they have to do is convince your computer (or any of the computers your computer connects to), that whatever malicious code they want to run is at the URL.\nThere are more involved methods of doing this like stealing peoples passwords and uploading malicious code, or hacking into a server etc. The method isn‚Äôt important, the point is that when we ask https://schulichignite.com/file.js for the file we have no way to make sure we are getting what we want. These attacks are often called CDN-poisioning or cache-poisioning. It feeds off a problem of authority. I can‚Äôt trust schulichignite.com and the only validation I can get that the code is correct is from schulichignite.com. Sort of like asking a theif if they took something, and just hoping they tell the truth. So the question as developers is how do we provide something to authenticate the file that works in HTML?\nWell, with our knowledge of hashes we can use a built-in attribute called subresource integrity to add integrity hashes to our javascript. All we do is include an integrity attribute that tells the browser which hash function to use (in our case SHA-1) and then the hash. For example:\n&lt;script src=&quot;https://schulichignite.com/file.js&quot; integrity=&quot;sha1-865cd55417af5a27ab17ae1fff7510c7acc4f250&quot; crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\nNow when the browser downloads the file it will run the contents as a string through the SHA-1 hashing algorithm, then check against 865cd55417af5a27ab17ae1fff7510c7acc4f250, and only run it if it matches.\nPasswords ¬ß\nStoring people‚Äôs passwords in plain text is bad. Imagine someone were to read your database and it had information like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnameemailpasswordKierankieran@canadiancoding.came_name_is_not_kieranJamiejamie@hotmail.co.ukwhiskers_is_life23Paulpaul@zmail.govP455W0RD\nKieran and Jamie both don‚Äôt deserve their password stolen (paul might with a password like that), so how do we make it so even if people get access to your database through a hack, or an annoyed ex-employee that your users are safe? Well a password only matters in order for us to know if someone should be allowed to login. So instead of storing the password we let the user type in their password and we just store the hash, since they can then use the same password to generate the same hash and login! and we have the bonus of storing information that is useless to hackers (assuming they can‚Äôt reverse the hash). So instead with our original database we get:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnameemailpasswordKierankieran@canadiancoding.ca3940687576951907022Jamiejamie@hotmail.co.uk6922927947780301451Paulpaul@zmail.govP455W0RD\n(Paul‚Äôs password doesn‚Äôt get hashed because he should feel bad about how bad his password is)\nSalting &amp; peppering ¬ß\nOne very easy to implement way of breaking up common hash collisions for passwords (and other uses) is to add salting. Salting is just adding characters to the end of an input. So for example if we have the input &quot;mypassword&quot; and the salt &quot;+_()*&amp;^%$#@!&quot; then we would hash using hash(&quot;mypassword+_()*&amp;^%$#@!&quot;). This way if something like &quot;hello123&quot; used to collide with &quot;mypassword&quot; then it does not imply hash(&quot;mypassword+_()*&amp;^%$#@!&quot;) == hash(&quot;hello123+_()*&amp;^%$#@!&quot;) (in most common hash functions).\nPeppering is the same idea except you add the pepper to the front of the text, and apply it before the salting. So if you have the pepper &quot;!@#$%^&amp;*()_+&quot;, then with the salt above and the same password as above you would do hash(&quot;!@#$%^&amp;*()_+mypassword+_()*&amp;^%$#@!&quot;).\nHash Collisions ¬ß\nLet‚Äôs say we have a hash function that takes in some text, converts each letter to an integer using an ASCII table, and then sums them to give you a hash. For this function any set of letters that are the same would give you the same hash. So if we called the function ASCII_Hash() then ASCII_Hash(&#039;xyz&#039;) == ASCII_Hash(&#039;yzx&#039;) == ASCII_Hash(&#039;zyx&#039;). These situations where different results provide the same hash are called hash collisions.\nHash collisions are a big problem especially for hashmaps and integrity hashes. It is quite common to have collisions in hash maps, when this happens it means that items that are collided and end up further down the linked list are slower to access. If we had a hashmap that used ASCII_Hash() if we inserted values with the keys &#039;xyz&#039;,&#039;yzx&#039;,&#039;zyx&#039; in that order, then to access the value of zyx we would first have to hash zyx, and then check xyz, then yzx, then finally find it at zyx. These performance hits can cause real problems. In algorithmic complexity notation we go from a constant time (O(1), which is a fancy way to say it takes as long as the hash function takes), to a linear time (O(n), where n is the number of elements that collide, meaning for every colliding element we go up by n * time taken to run). This difference means our hash tables scale horribly over time:\n\n(time to run is measured in how long it takes to access each element in the linked list)\nThis opens up tons of problems like general slowdowns and even denial of service (DOS) attacks, where if you know enough collisions you can keep creating more and more collisions to crash a python server.\nIntegrity hashes are even worse. Hash collisions in integrity hashes are very dangerous. What they imply is that your method of validating something is what it says it is can work for something that isn‚Äôt what you were looking for. Similar to having a security guard that lets in every person named dave because you forgot to specify which dave you wanted to let in. There are tools designed to help generate these collisions, and if someone manages to find a collision and inject malicious code into a file, while you confirm it as ‚Äúsafe‚Äù it can cause big issues.\nPasswords can also have huge issues with hash collisions. Remember what I said about someone being able to hack into a database and just see the hashes. Well if they can create hash collisions then they can access someones account without needing their password. They just need to guess the hash algorithm you‚Äôre using, know the hash they‚Äôre targetting, and if they can create a password that matches the hash then they can get into the account!\nHash-based Data structures ¬ß\nHashmaps/dictionaries/hashtables are a common datastructure that allow you to create key-value pairs. This is what runs behind the scenes for many JSON implementations. So with a JSON file like:\n{\n    &quot;name&quot;:&quot;kieran&quot;,\n}\nIn this case name is our key, and kieran is our value. From here there are 2 classes/structs we will need a Node and a HashTable. In pseudocode they would look like this:\nclass Node:\n    key: str\n    value: any\n\nclass HashTable:\n    buckets: List[List[Node]]\n\nA node will be where we store the key-value pair, which will then be placed into our buckets list/Array. We also need to decide how many buckets we want, for now we will arbitrarily pick 6 (because it makes the drawings easier üòâ) but we will discuss what more or less buckets does shortly. The basic idea is that we will use a hashing function to generate an index location in the buckets list, we will then insert the node at that index in the buckets list. This means that for searching later we can skip searching all values in any of the other buckets!\nSo the insertion would take the steps:\n\nCreate HashTable with 6 empty buckets\nTake the key you want to insert and hash it with some algorithm (make sure resulting hash is just numbers)\nTake that hash and modulo (divide by and take the remainder) it by the number of buckets (in our case 6)\nCreate a node which contains the value and the key\nInsert the node into the index you calculated from the key\n\nSteps 1-4:\n\nStep 5:\n\nHere is what inserting would look like in pseudocode:\nht = HashTable([[],[],[],[],[],[]]) # 1. Create HashTable with 6 empty buckets\n\nfunction insert_into_hash_table(ht:HashTable, key:str, value: Any):\n    # 2. Take the key you want to insert and hash it with some algorithm (make sure resulting hash is just numbers)\n    hashed_key = hash(key)\n    # 3. Take that hash and modulo (divide by and take the remainder) it by the number of buckets (in our case 6)\n    index = int(hashed_key % 6)\n    # 4. Create a node which contains the value and the key\n    new_node = Node(key, value)\n    # 5. Insert the node into the index you calculated from the key\n    ht.buckets[index].insert(new_node)\n\nThe reason why this is handy is because compared to a normal list of every value we do the hash function first (which is fast), then we only have to search the bucket from the index we generated! So the basic algorithm for searching would be:\n\nTake the key you want to find and hash it with some algorithm (make sure resulting hash is just numbers)\nTake that hash and modulo (divide by and take the remainder) it by the number of buckets (in our case 6)\nLook into the HashTable at the given index, if list at index is empty throw an error, if not then go through the list at that index and check each node in the list until you find one with the same key, if you hit the end of the list then throw an error\n\nThe pseudocode would look like:\nfunction search_hash_table(ht:HashTable, key:str):\n    # 1. Take the key you want to insert and hash it with some algorithm (make sure resulting hash is just numbers)\n    hashed_key = hash(key)\n\n    # 2. Take that hash and modulo (divide by and take the remainder) it by the number of buckets (in our case 6)\n    index = int(hashed_key % 6)\n\n    # 3. Look into the `HashTable` at the given index\n\n    ## 3.1 Check if index list is empty\n    if length(ht.buckets[index]) == 0:\n        raise Error(&quot;Key not in HashTable&quot;)\n\n    ## 3.2 go through the list at that index and check each node in the list until you find one with the same key\n    for node in ht.buckets[index]:\n        if node.key == key:\n            return node.value\n\n    ## 3.3 You reached the end of the list without finding the key\n    raise Error(&quot;Key not in HashTable&quot;)\n\nOn the positive side this means if we have a large collection of buckets and our hashes are mostly unique we can skip a ton of values while searching!\nBut on the negative side keep in mind that every bucket that isn‚Äôt being used is wasting memory with an empty list, so be careful what number of buckets you choose. Also keep in mind that collisions will cause the same index to be used, which means every collision makes the efficiency of looking up the node you are adding go down.\nHashability ¬ß\nPython (and lots of languages), will only allow you to hash certain data types. Specifically each data type will have a built in hash function, which defines how that data type should be hashed. In python since all data types are classes, this means that the class must have a __hash__() method. In lots of cases in different languages this ends up being only applicable to immutable data types.\nAn immutable data type is a type of data that cannot be changed. For example tuples have their data set in stone, you cannot append or modify them without reassigning the variable set to a tuple to a new value. For example with tuple‚Äôs to add a value ‚Äúto a tuple‚Äù we would create a new tuple with the same values, and our new value in it. This concept gets complicated in python, but the most important weird situation is that lists are not able to be keys in any dictionaries/hashmaps because the built-in __hash__() function does not work on it. There are several reasons for this, but the main one is that you can mutate the data such as appending and popping items from the list (this article explains in more details why).\nCommon hashing algorithms ¬ß\nGeneral Hashing:\n\nSHA (very common, somewhat secure, very fast)\n\nWikipedia page\nHow SHA-1 Works (Brilliant)\nHow SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) works? by Marcello Faria\nHow Does SHA-1 Work - Intro to Cryptographic Hash Functions and SHA-1\nSHA 256 | SHA 256 Algorithm Explanation | How SHA 256 Algorithm Works | Cryptography | Simplilearn\nSHA-256 | COMPLETE Step-By-Step Explanation (W/ Example)\nSHA: Secure Hashing Algorithm - Computerphile\n\n\nMD5 (not very secure, but very very fast)\n\nWikipedia page\nMD5 Algorithm | What Is MD5 Algorithm? | MD5 Algorithm Explained | Network Security | Simplilearn\n#34 MD5 Algorithm ( Message Digest 5) Working and Example |CNS|\nWhat is the MD5 Algorithm?\n\n\n\nFor passwords there are more involved hashing algorithms you can look into.

Should users be able to see the source code to the program you‚Äôre asking them to run? Should you be able to know the internals of what‚Äôs happening in your computer? Much of the software we used today is closed source and proprietary, meaning we don‚Äôt know how it works, since we can‚Äôt view the source code. This is in contrast to many other products like cars for example where we can open it up while it‚Äôs running to determine how it works.\nFree and open source software (FOSS) is a movement that says that users have the right to know what is running, and should be able to understand what‚Äôs happening on their devices.\nOther benefits:\n\nPeople who want a feature can create it and contribute it back to the project for other people to use\nBugs and security flaws can be found and patched\nPeople can learn from existing code\nPrivacy audits can be done on code you are running\nCan take¬†libraries and API‚Äôs¬†and stick them together to build a bigger overall project\n\nOpen source is¬†very¬†popular in software development. Many of the projects that power the internet are open source. Here are a few examples:\n\nlinux kernel; What runs all ‚Äúlinux‚Äù operating systems, which account for over %90 of server market share¬†1\nBootstrap; Popular CSS framework used to build over %20 of sites 2\nPython; Yep the source code for the python programming language is fully open source and you can see exactly how it works\n\nThere are many more examples, but basically most of modern development runs on open source!\nFree software vs Open Source ¬ß\nInside you there are two wolves3‚Ä¶ in all seriousness with open source &amp; free software (abbreviated to FOSS) there are broadly speaking 2 ‚Äúcamps‚Äù or schools of thought, the people interested in it philosophically (free software advocates), and those interested in it ‚Äúpragmatically‚Äù (open source advocates). These schools of thought can overlap, but they are often at odds, namely in their level of commitment.\nPeople like Richard Stallman actually take it further from just open source to free/libre software4. The common phrase used to explain this is ‚Äúfree as in free speech, not as in free beer‚Äù. Free software goes beyond traditional open source and expands to encompass a more stringent philosophy. Free software generally has 4 tenets5, those being:\n\nThe user should have the freedom to run the software as they wish, for whatever purpose\nThe user should have the freedom to change the software and how it runs, therefore free software required open source\nThe user should have the freedom to redistribute their software\nThe user should have the freedom to redistribute their software with their changes\n\nBruce Perens and others on the Debian team have actually expanded these out to the ‚Äúten commandments‚Äù or ‚Äúsocial contract‚Äù :\n\n\n\nFree Redistribution\nThe license of a Debian component may not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources. The license may not require a royalty or other fee for such sale.\n\n\nSource Code\nThe program must include source code, and must allow distribution in source code as well as compiled form.\n\n\nDerived Works\nThe license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software.\n\n\nIntegrity of The Author‚Äôs Source Code\nThe license may restrict source-code from being distributed in modified form¬†only¬†if the license allows the distribution of¬†patch files¬†with the source code for the purpose of modifying the program at build time. The license must explicitly permit distribution of software built from modified source code. The license may require derived works to carry a different name or version number from the original software. (This is a compromise. The Debian group encourages all authors not to restrict any files, source or binary, from being modified.)\n\n\nNo Discrimination Against Persons or Groups\nThe license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons.\n\n\nNo Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor\nThe license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the program from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research.\n\n\nDistribution of License\nThe rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the program is redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license by those parties.\n\n\nLicense Must Not Be Specific to Debian\nThe rights attached to the program must not depend on the program‚Äôs being part of a Debian system. If the program is extracted from Debian and used or distributed without Debian but otherwise within the terms of the program‚Äôs license, all parties to whom the program is redistributed should have the same rights as those that are granted in conjunction with the Debian system.\n\n\nLicense Must Not Contaminate Other Software\nThe license must not place restrictions on other software that is distributed along with the licensed software. For example, the license must not insist that all other programs distributed on the same medium must be free software.\n\n\nExample Licenses\nThe¬†GPL,¬†BSD, and¬†Artistic¬†licenses are examples of licenses that we consider¬†free.\n\n\n\nFrom the Debian Social contract 6\n\n\nWithout these rules being obeyed the argument is that the user is not in control of a program, but rather the program controls the user. These stipulations are what allow the sort of control that free software advocates would call ‚Äúfree or libre‚Äù.\nThe people who are philosophically interested in FOSS care about ‚Äúlibre‚Äù and about the freedom for users. This interest often comes in spite of particular financial incentives.  For example people who are philosophically interested in FOSS would not allow companies to collect data on them, even if it couldn‚Äôt be leaked because the individual should have the freedom to not be known to software developers and companies. This commitment would often also play out in the form of buying components that have open source firmware. running only FOSS operating systems, and generally having products that as much as humanly possible are fully FOSS, even if it means making sacrifices for those commitments7.\nOn the other hand the pragmatist is only interested in FOSS for as far as it serves a practical purpose. Whether its benefits to security, collaboration driving features, or any other benefit, that is what they are committed to. However something not being FOSS only matters in so far as the pros outweigh the cons. Essentially the pragmatic view is only concerned with the consequences of choosing a particular piece of software or hardware, whereas the philosophically interested are more ideological, and even if there are downsides they will still pick a FOSS option because it‚Äôs ‚Äúthe right thing to do‚Äù.\nLicensing ¬ß\n\n\n                  \n                  DISCLAIMER \n                  \n                \nThis is not legal advise, if you‚Äôre going to put this into practice get it looked over by a lawyer first. We‚Äôre not responsible if something goes wrong, I‚Äôm a developer not a lawyer.\n\nOn top of that, a few things to consider while reading:\n\nLaws change over time\nLaws are different in different countries\nLegal systems are often not intuitive. Don‚Äôt just assume it works ‚Äúthe obvious way‚Äù, look it up, or ask a lawyer\n\nA license is basically the thing that tells you what you can do with some software. Sometimes you buy ‚Äúlicense keys‚Äù in order to gain access, other times the licenses are implicit, meaning you agree to them when you use the software. These¬†must¬†be stated either somewhere in the software, and/or¬†must¬†be available in some form to be considered valid. That means if you are just providing a binary/executable, you must have some way for someone to read the license that is available to them.\nGenerally in software development we care about licenses for source code (code used to create the program), but licenses can exist in many forms. For example you might buy a license to use a photo, or to ‚Äúunlock‚Äù a piece of software etc.\nSource code licenses can be used to determine:\n\nIf you can use the code in your project\nIf you can use the project name in your project\nIf you have to send back any changes you make\nIf you are allowed to make any changes to the code\nIf you are allowed to use the code without purchase\nIf the code comes with a warranty\nIf you can change the license to the code &amp; usually which are ‚Äúcompatible‚Äù\netc.\n\nThere are a few common misconceptions about source code licenses:\n\nProjects don‚Äôt have to have¬†just 1¬†license, portions of the code can be licensed differently (this gets messy though)\nLicenses do not imply¬†copyright, or trademarks, just because Facebook has open source libraries you can use code doesn‚Äôt mean you can use their brand name\n\nOpen Source Licenses ¬ß\nOpen source licenses are a particular type of license that is intended to license code according to terms that are in line with open source principles. These come in various flavors, some of which obey the full ‚Äúfree software‚Äù principles, and others which just obey ‚Äúopen source‚Äù principles.\nCopyleft ¬ß\nCopyleft is the opposite of copyright. Instead of being closed by default any copyleft licenses will require derivative products (products made with code that is copyleft) to also be open source. For example¬†GNU GPLv3¬†requires you to disclose the source code:\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nAs well as other things like disclose any changes, and you also must maintain the license in any derivatives. This means if you create a new project based off a GPLv3 codebase, your code has to adhere to the same rules!\nCommon open source licenses ¬ß\nIn the open source community there are lots of licenses, and families of licenses that come up a lot\n\nMIT¬†is an incredibly popular license that is incredibly permissible. It lets people do (mostly) whatever they want with the code, while still refusing to supply a warranty. When in doubt, I highly recommend it.\nGPL is a family of licenses. The two most popular are (there‚Äôs also¬†AGPL¬†and others)\n\nGPLV3; Highly popular option that requires people to make any derivatives based off the software also open source.\nLGPLv3; Has similar terms to GLPv3 except if the project only includes the code to be used as a¬†library¬†then the remainder of the program doesn‚Äôt have to be under the same terms\n\n\nCreative commons¬†is a family of licenses that are generally permissive, but each ‚Äúcode‚Äù has different requirements to satisfy. One thing to keep in mind is that the license is¬†non-revokable, meaning even if you want to stop sharing later anyone who has copies can do what they want so long as they‚Äôre within the original terms. You can see the full list¬†here, but some common ones include:\n\nCC-BY: You can do what you want, but the original creator must be credited somehow\nCC-BY-SA: You can do what you want, but the original creator must be credited somehow and all adaptations must have the same terms\nCC-0: The work is fully public domain and you give up all rights (including copyright) to the content\n\n\nApache 2¬†is a common license for big company projects because it allows a project to be open source, while keeping people from being able to use your trademarks\n\nContent Licensing ¬ß\nThe idea of FOSS has also inspired many movements to ‚Äúdemocratize information‚Äù. This means instead of having the traditional proprietary approaches to content being produced, just like source code the information for content is open for people to use.\nPublic Domain &amp; Creative commons ¬ß\nThe public domain is the name for any content that doesn‚Äôt fall under any intellectual property claims8. This can be people volunteering their content, or if licensing expires in a country (such as Winnie the pooh9 10).\nThe creative commons is a non-profit group that is devoted to help bring works into the public domain, and/or make it easy to license content in a way that makes it accessible to everyone. Creative commons licenses will typically have at least 1 stipulation. One thing to keep in mind is you often can‚Äôt remove the license you pick. There are a ton of different possible licenses available for people to choose from that have various different stipulations, some popular ones are:\n\nCC By 4.0 (Attribution 4.0 International)\n\nPeople must include attribution11\n\n\nCC By-SA 4.0 (Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International)\n\nPeople must include attribution\nCannot change the license\n\n\nCC BY-NC-SA 4.0 (Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International)\n\nMust include attribution\nCannot use it in commercial projects\nCannot change the license of the text\n\n\nCC BY-ND 4.0 (Attribution-NoDerivs 4.0 International)\n\nMust include attribution\nCannot modify or adapt content\n\n\n\nIf you are planning to use these licenses they have a tool to help choose, and I would recommend using it.\nMIT Open Courseware ¬ß\nIn 2001 MIT launched the OpenCourseWare project12. This project was trying to help democratize the access to university level course content. They distribute the content on multiple platforms, details for which can be found here.\nCritiques of open source ¬ß\nWhile the idea of open source sounds great there are many critiques in practice. While these shouldn‚Äôt necessarily dissuade you from developing open source they are things to keep in mind. These are various situations that caused issues in open source projects:\n\nLittle to no accountability\n\nThe Dark Side of Open Source // What really happened to Faker.js?

Essentially this means that the source code used to create an app is not disclosed. So for example if you have a large company that distributes videos, you may have no idea what code is running on their servers to process your data. It‚Äôs important to keep in mind that closed source does not guarantee that something is¬†proprietary¬†(created by the company, for the company). Many closed source systems actually rely (sometimes entirely) on¬†open source¬†software.\nAssuming the other software you‚Äôre using does not have any conflicts with the licenses it is there is nothing stopping people from writing closed source software.\nThere are some arguable advantages to doing so, such as if you‚Äôre in any of these situations:\n\nYou are one of the first groups in a field and want to keep your head start\nYou are using methods of solving a problem that haven‚Äôt been patented/published yet\n\nMany countries use a ‚Äúfirst to patent‚Äù approach, meaning even if you created the technology you can be sued out of using it if someone patents it before you\n\n\nYou just don‚Äôt want people to use your code\n\nUltimately projects you create are yours, unless stipulated by other dependencies people don‚Äôt have any right to tell you what you can and cannot do\n\n\n\nBad reasons to do closed source ¬ß\nWith everything being said, some people opt to do close source for bad reasons. Here are a few¬†bad reasons¬†to do closed source.\nSecurity through obscurity ¬ß\nThe idea is that something can be secured by just making it hard to find. For example you might have a ‚Äúclosed source‚Äù file with all the passwords in it, or a server that uses an encryption key in a weird directory so people are less likely to find it.\nOne real world example of this was a story I heard from someone who wrote firmware for a router company that used to ‚Äútrust‚Äù devices by having them send signals with set time intervals. So for example it would send a letter ‚Äúa‚Äù after establishing a connection at 1, 1.3, 1.5, 1.8, and 3 seconds. The idea being this pattern was so ‚Äúrandom‚Äù, that it should be secure.\nThis isn‚Äôt security, at best it‚Äôs just inconvenient for people trying to steal your information. Close sourcing something because you don‚Äôt know how to do security is just irresponsible, not clever. People should be able to know which encryption system, or software your using and¬†still not be able to break in (often called zero trust systems. If just having to know some small piece of information allows people to break in, then it‚Äôs just a matter of your project having information worth stealing before someone will get in.\nUniqueness/proprietary system ¬ß\nMany times when people are creating projects they intend to sell they will try to not be transparent with the technologies they use. If they create websites they want customers to think they use some ‚Äúspecial sauce‚Äù system to create them that requires the company. This being a reason to close source is also a bad idea if you are actually just using open source projects to build with. Not only because it‚Äôs dishonest, but depending on what you‚Äôre doing the claims themselves can be illegal.\nIf you lie to someone in order to get them to work with you, in most countries you‚Äôre committing fraud. It‚Äôs fine if you don‚Äôt want people to know what you‚Äôre using, but that should be the stated reason. Trying to hide behind closing your source to ramp up the price, and/or lie about implementation details can create a lot of problems.\nAdditional Resources ¬ß\n\nOpen Source Guides | Learn how to launch and grow your project.\nArticles &amp; Blog posts on the topic\n\nStealing Like a Developer | Schulich Ignite\nThe Open-Source Philosophy / Blogs / Perficient\nLateNite Legacy Blog (latenitefilms.com)\n\n\nAaron Swartz\n\nAaron Swartz‚Äô Death Fuels MIT Probe, White House Petition to Oust Prosecutor - ABC News (go.com)\nAaron Swartz‚Äôs Brilliant Life and Tragic Death (rollingstone.com)\nThe Darker Side of Aaron Swartz | The New Yorker\nAaron Swartz\n\n\nInteresting Licenses\n\nCommercial charging\n\nYou only charge commercial users\nWinRAR\n\nWinRAR And The Infinite 40-Day Trial (youtube.com)\nWinRAR 5.0: Interview with CEO Burak Canboy - Softonic\n\n\nObsidian\n\nLicense Overview - Obsidian\nMy problem with obsidian is that I need a license to use it if I add something w‚Ä¶ | Hacker News (ycombinator.com)\nRedis Licensing Overview | Redis\n\n\nDual Licensing\n\nRedis\n\nRedis Adopts Dual Source-Available Licensing | Redis\nRedis switches licenses, acquires Speedb to go beyond its core in-memory database | TechCrunch\n\n\n\n\nSSPL\n\nThe SSPL is Not an Open Source License - Voices of Open Source\nMongoDB\n\nFree (non-commercial version) uses AGPL MongoDB Licensing | MongoDB, but commercial is different\nDoes the MongoDB License Threaten the Future of the Gnu Public License?

Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has steadily grown in popularity due to its simplicity and readability. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, making it an ideal choice for both beginners and experienced programmers. Python‚Äôs ease of use, combined with its robust libraries and frameworks, has made it a top choice for a wide range of applications, from web development and data analysis to artificial intelligence and scientific computing.\nOne of Python‚Äôs key strengths is its extensive standard library (largely housed on¬†PyPi), which provides a wide array of modules and packages that simplify tasks such as file handling, machine learning, networking, web development and even graphical user interface (GUI) development. Python‚Äôs versatility extends to its cross-platform compatibility, as it can be run on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Furthermore, its open-source nature fosters a vibrant community of developers who continuously contribute to its growth, ensuring that Python remains at the forefront of programming languages.\nPython‚Äôs reputation as a go-to language for data science and machine learning has skyrocketed in recent years. Libraries like¬†NumPy,¬†pandas, and¬†scikit-learn¬†empower data scientists to efficiently manipulate and analyze data, while frameworks like¬†TensorFlow¬†and¬†PyTorch¬†provide powerful tools for building and training machine learning models. Likewise¬†Flask,¬†FastAPI, and¬†Django¬†are web development frameworks that have become staples of modern web development. Python‚Äôs simplicity, combined with these libraries and frameworks, has made it a driving force in the rapidly evolving fields of artificial intelligence and data-driven decision-making. In summary, Python‚Äôs blend of simplicity, versatility, and a thriving ecosystem make it a language of choice for developers across a wide spectrum of disciplines, making it a timeless and invaluable tool in the world of programming.\nCREATING AND USING FILES ¬ß\nCreating and using Python files, also known as Python scripts, is the foundation of writing and running Python programs. Here‚Äôs a beginner-friendly explanation of how to get started:\nINSTALLING PYTHON ¬ß\n\nBefore you start creating Python files, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).\nFollow the installation instructions for your operating system.\n\nEDITING PYTHON CODE ¬ß\n\nYou can write Python code using a simple text editor (like Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on macOS) or use specialized Python IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) like Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or IDLE.\nChoose the option that suits you best. IDEs provide additional features to make coding easier.\n\nCREATING A PYTHON FILE ¬ß\n\nIn your chosen text editor or IDE, create a new file. To do this, go to ‚ÄúFile‚Äù &gt; ‚ÄúNew‚Äù or press¬†Ctrl+N¬†(Windows) or¬†Cmd+N¬†(macOS).\nSave the file with a¬†.py¬†extension, which indicates it‚Äôs a Python script. For example, you can save it as¬†my_script.py.\n\nWRITING YOUR FIRST PYTHON CODE ¬ß\n\nIn your newly created Python file, you can start writing Python code. Here‚Äôs a simple ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù example:\n\nprint(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)\n\nThis code uses the¬†print()¬†function to display ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù on the screen.\n\nRUNNING YOUR PYTHON SCRIPT ¬ß\n\nTo run your Python script, you need to open a terminal or command prompt.\nNavigate to the directory where your Python file is located using the¬†cd¬†command (e.g.,¬†cd Documents¬†if your file is in the ‚ÄúDocuments‚Äù folder).\nThen, type¬†python¬†followed by the name of your Python file and press Enter:\n\npython my_script.py\n\nYour Python script will execute, and you‚Äôll see the output in the terminal.\n\nEDITING AND SAVING CHANGES ¬ß\n\nYou can make changes to your Python file by opening it in your text editor or IDE, editing the code, and saving the file (usually by pressing¬†Ctrl+S¬†or¬†Cmd+S).\nAfter saving, you can rerun the script to see the updated results.\n\nLEARNING AND EXPERIMENTING ¬ß\n\nPython is a versatile language with many features and libraries. You can learn by exploring Python tutorials, books, or online courses.\nAs you learn, you can create more complex Python scripts to perform various tasks, from simple calculations to building web applications or analyzing data.\n\nThat‚Äôs the basic process of creating and using Python files. Start with simple scripts like ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù and gradually build your skills by tackling more advanced projects. Python is known for its readability and simplicity, making it an excellent choice for beginners to start their coding journey.\nVARIABLES &amp; TYPES ¬ß\nPython is a versatile programming language that can work with various types of data. Here‚Äôs a basic overview of three fundamental data types:¬†int,¬†float, and¬†str. These 3 data types help to make up most of the basic operations you will do.\nINTEGERS (INT) ¬ß\nIntegers are whole numbers, which means they don‚Äôt have any decimal points.\n\nYou can use integers for counting, indexing, and performing arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction.\nFor Example:¬†5,¬†-10,¬†1000\n\nmy_integer = 42\nprint(my_integer)  # Output: 42\nFLOATING-POINT NUMBERS (FLOAT) ¬ß\n\nFloating-point numbers, or floats, are numbers that can have decimal points.\nYou use floats when you need to represent values with precision, such as measurements or calculations involving fractions.\nExample:¬†3.14,¬†-0.5,¬†2.0\n\nmy_float = 3.14159\nprint(my_float)  # Output: 3.14159\nSTRINGS (STR) ¬ß\n\nStrings are sequences of characters, like text or words, enclosed in single (‚Äô ‚Äò), double (‚Äù ‚Äú), or triple (‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô ‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô or ‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù) quotes.\nYou can manipulate strings, concatenate them (combine them), and perform various operations like searching for specific characters.\nExample:¬†&#039;Hello, World!&#039;,¬†&quot;Python is fun&quot;,¬†&#039;&#039;&#039;Triple-quoted strings&#039;&#039;&#039;\n\nmy_string = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;\nprint(my_string)  # Output: Hello, World!\nThese three basic data types are the building blocks for most Python programs. You can perform operations on them, combine them, and use them to represent different kinds of data in your code. As you continue to learn Python, you‚Äôll discover more data types and ways to work with them, but these are the essential ones to get started.\nCOLLECTIONS ¬ß\nIf you are not familiar you can find details about what collections are¬†here.\nPython provides two common collection types, lists, and tuples. These collection types allow you to store multiple values in a single variable.\nLists ¬ß\n\nA list is an ordered collection of items.\nYou can store various types of data in a list, such as numbers, strings, or even other lists.\nLists are mutable, which means you can change their contents (add, remove, or modify elements).\n\nCreating a List:¬†To create a list, use square brackets¬†[]¬†and separate the items with commas.\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, &quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;]\nAccessing Elements:¬†You can access individual elements in a list by their position, called an index. Python uses zero-based indexing, so the first element is at index 0.\nfirst_item = my_list[0]  # Gets the first item (1)second_item = my_list[1]  # Gets the second item (2)\nModifying a List:¬†You can change, add, or remove items from a list.\nmy_list[3] = &quot;cherry&quot;  # Modifies an item (changes &quot;apple&quot; to &quot;cherry&quot;)my_list.append(4)  # Adds an item to the end (appends 4)my_list.remove(&quot;banana&quot;)  # Removes an item (removes &quot;banana&quot;)\nTuples ¬ß\n\nA tuple is similar to a list, but it is immutable, meaning you cannot change its elements once it‚Äôs created.\nTuples are typically used when you want to create a collection of items that should not be modified.\n\nCreating a Tuple:¬†To create a tuple, use parentheses¬†()¬†and separate the items with commas.\nmy_tuple = (1, 2, 3, &quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;)\nAccessing Elements:¬†You access tuple elements in the same way as with lists, using zero-based indexing.\nfirst_item = my_tuple[0]  # Gets the first item (1)second_item = my_tuple[1]  # Gets the second item (2)\nImmutable Nature:¬†You cannot change the elements of a tuple after creation. Attempting to do so will result in an error.\nmy_tuple[3] = &quot;cherry&quot;  # This will raise an error (Tuples are immutable)\nWhen to Use Lists vs. Tuples:\n\nUse lists when you need a collection of items that can change over time.\nUse tuples when you want to create a collection of items that should remain constant.\n\nHere‚Äôs a simple summary: Lists are like dynamic containers where you can put different things and change them, while tuples are like sealed containers where you put things that won‚Äôt change. Both are valuable tools in Python, and your choice depends on your specific needs in a program.\nFUNCTIONS ¬ß\nIf you are not familiar you can find details about what functions are¬†here.\nPython functions are like mini-programs or reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. Think of them as functions in math, where you input something, and it gives you a result. In Python, you can create your own functions to perform tasks you need. Here‚Äôs a beginner-friendly explanation:\nDEFINING A FUNCTION ¬ß\n\nTo create a function, you use the¬†def¬†keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses¬†(). You can also include parameters (input values) inside the parentheses.\n\ndef greet(name):    \n    print(&quot;Hello, &quot; + name + &quot;!&quot;)\n\nIn this example, we defined a function called¬†greet¬†that takes one parameter,¬†name.\n\nCALLING A FUNCTION ¬ß\n\nOnce you‚Äôve defined a function, you can use it by calling it. To call a function, you simply write its name followed by parentheses and any necessary arguments (values for the parameters).\n\ngreet(&quot;Alice&quot;)\n\nThis line of code calls the¬†greet¬†function and passes¬†&quot;Alice&quot;¬†as the¬†name¬†parameter.\n\nRETURN VALUES ¬ß\n\nFunctions can also return a result using the¬†return¬†keyword. This is like the answer you get from a math function.\n\ndef add(a, b):    \n    result = a + b    \n    return result\n\nIn this example, the¬†add¬†function takes two parameters,¬†a¬†and¬†b, adds them together, and returns the result.\n\nsum_result = add(5, 3)\nprint(sum_result)  # Output: 8\n\nHere, we call the¬†add¬†function with¬†5¬†and¬†3¬†as arguments and store the result in the¬†sum_result¬†variable.\n\nREUSABILITY ¬ß\n\nFunctions make your code more organized and reusable. You can use the same function multiple times throughout your program.\n\nSCOPE ¬ß\n\nVariables defined inside a function have local scope, meaning they can only be accessed within that function. Variables outside the function have global scope, which means they can be used throughout your code.\n\nBUILT-IN FUNCTIONS ¬ß\n\nPython also comes with many built-in functions, like¬†print(),¬†len(), and¬†input(), which you can use without having to define them yourself.\n\nHere‚Äôs a simple summary: Functions in Python allow you to define a set of instructions that can be used over and over again. They take input, perform actions, and can return results. Functions are like handy tools you create to make your coding tasks easier and more organized.\nCONTROL FLOWS ¬ß\nPython control flows, especially the¬†if¬†statement, help you make decisions in your code. Think of them as instructions to your program to perform certain actions based on conditions. Let‚Äôs break it down in a beginner-friendly way:\nTHE¬†IF¬†STATEMENT ¬ß\n\nThe¬†if¬†statement is used to make decisions in Python.\nIt allows your program to execute different code blocks depending on whether a condition is true or false.\n\nBASIC¬†IF¬†SYNTAX ¬ß\n\nThe basic structure of an¬†if¬†statement looks like this:\n\nif condition:    \n    # Code to execute if the condition is True\n\nThe¬†condition¬†is an expression that evaluates to either¬†True¬†or¬†False.\n\nTRUTHINESS ¬ß\n\nIn Python, many things can be considered either ‚Äútruthy‚Äù or ‚Äúfalsy.‚Äù This means that they can be evaluated as equivalent to¬†True¬†or¬†False¬†in a boolean context.\nCommon truthy values include non-zero numbers, non-empty strings, and non-empty containers (like lists or dictionaries).\nCommon falsy values include¬†0, an empty string¬†&quot;&quot;, and empty containers.\n\nBOOLEAN LOGICAL COMPARISONS ¬ß\n\n\nYou can compare values using boolean logical operators to create conditions in your¬†if¬†statements.\n\n\nCommon boolean operators are:\n\n==¬†(equal): Checks if two values are equal.\n!=¬†(not equal): Checks if two values are not equal.\n&lt;¬†(less than): Checks if one value is less than another.\n&gt;¬†(greater than): Checks if one value is greater than another.\n&lt;=¬†(less than or equal to): Checks if one value is less than or equal to another.\n&gt;=¬†(greater than or equal to): Checks if one value is greater than or equal to another.\n\n\n\nExample:\nx = 5\ny = 10 \nif x &lt; y:    \n    print(&quot;x is less than y&quot;)\n\nIn this example, the¬†if¬†statement checks if¬†x¬†is less than¬†y. If it‚Äôs true, it prints ‚Äúx is less than y.‚Äù\n\nELSE¬†AND¬†ELIF¬†(ELSE-IF) STATEMENTS ¬ß\n\nYou can extend¬†if¬†statements with¬†else¬†and¬†elif¬†(else-if) statements to handle multiple conditions.\n\nExample:\nage = 20 \nif age &lt; 18:    \n    print(&quot;You are underage.&quot;)\nelif age &gt;= 18 and age &lt; 65:\n    print(&quot;You are an adult.&quot;)\nelse:    \n    print(&quot;You are a senior citizen.&quot;)\n\nIn this example, the code checks different conditions based on the age variable and prints an appropriate message.\n\nNESTED¬†IF¬†STATEMENTS ¬ß\n\nYou can also nest¬†if¬†statements inside other¬†if¬†statements to handle more complex conditions.\n\nExample:\nx = 5 \nif x &gt; 0:\n\tif x % 2 == 0:\n\t    print(&quot;x is a positive even number.&quot;)\n\telse:        print(&quot;x is a positive odd number.&quot;)\nelse:    \n    print(&quot;x is not a positive number.&quot;)\n\nIn this example, we have nested¬†if¬†statements to determine whether¬†x¬†is positive and even or positive and odd.\n\nIn summary,¬†if¬†statements allow your Python program to make decisions based on conditions. You can use boolean operators to create conditions, and you can include¬†else¬†and¬†elif¬†statements for more complex decision-making. This is a fundamental building block for creating dynamic and responsive code in Python.\nLOOPS ¬ß\nPython loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code. They allow you to automate repetitive tasks by running the same code multiple times. Let‚Äôs explore Python loops in a beginner-friendly way:\nThe¬†for¬†Loop ¬ß\n\nA¬†for¬†loop is used when you know how many times you want to repeat a certain action. It‚Äôs often used to iterate over a sequence, such as a list or a range of numbers.\n\nBasic¬†for¬†Loop Syntax:\nfor variable in sequence:    \n    # Code to execute in each iteration\n\nvariable¬†represents an item from the sequence in each iteration, and¬†sequence¬†is the collection of items to loop through.\n\nExample:\nfruits = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;cherry&quot;] \nfor fruit in fruits:\n    print(fruit)\n\nIn this example, the¬†for¬†loop iterates through the¬†fruits¬†list and prints each fruit one by one.\n\nThe¬†while¬†Loop ¬ß\n\nA¬†while¬†loop is used when you want to repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. It‚Äôs often used when you don‚Äôt know in advance how many times the loop will run.\n\nBasic¬†while¬†Loop Syntax:\nwhile condition:    \n    # Code to execute as long as the condition is True\n\nThe loop will continue running as long as¬†condition¬†remains¬†True.\n\nExample:\ncount = 0 \nwhile count &lt; 5:    \n    print(&quot;Count: &quot;, count)    \n    count += 1\n\nIn this example, the¬†while¬†loop prints the value of¬†count¬†as long as it‚Äôs less than¬†5, incrementing¬†count¬†in each iteration.\n\nLoop Control Statements ¬ß\n\nYou can control the flow of loops using special statements:\n\nbreak: Terminates the loop prematurely.\ncontinue: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next.\n\n\n\nExample (using¬†break):\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] \nfor num in numbers:    \n    if num == 4:        \n    break  # Exit the loop when num is 4    \nprint(num)\n\nIn this example, the loop stops when¬†num¬†becomes¬†4, and the code after the loop continues executing.\n\nExample (using¬†continue):\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] \nfor num in numbers:    \n    if num % 2 == 0:        \n        continue  # Skip even numbers    \n\tprint(num)\n\nIn this example, the loop skips even numbers and continues to the next iteration.\n\nPython loops are powerful tools for automating repetitive tasks and processing data. By understanding¬†for¬†and¬†while¬†loops and how to control their flow, you can make your programs more dynamic and efficient.\nDEFINING YOUR OWN TYPES ¬ß\nIn Python, classes are like blueprints for creating objects. Think of a class as a template that defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will have. Let‚Äôs break down Python classes in a beginner-friendly way:\nCLASS DEFINITION ¬ß\n\nTo create a class, you use the¬†class¬†keyword, followed by the name of the class (usually starting with a capital letter).\n\nclass Dog:    \n    # Class definition goes here\n\nIn this example, we‚Äôve defined a class called¬†Dog.\n\nATTRIBUTES ¬ß\n\nAttributes are variables that store data within a class. They represent the characteristics or properties of objects created from the class.\n\nclass Dog:    \n    breed = &quot;Unknown&quot;  # Attribute to store the dog&#039;s breed    \n    age = 0            # Attribute to store the dog&#039;s age\n\nIn this class,¬†breed¬†and¬†age¬†are attributes that every dog object will have.\n\nMETHODS ¬ß\n\nMethods are functions defined within a class. They represent the actions or behaviors that objects of the class can perform.\n\nclass Dog:    \n    breed = &quot;Unknown&quot;    \n    age = 0     \n \n    def bark(self):        \n        print(&quot;Woof! Woof!&quot;)    \n \n    def fetch(self):       \n        print(&quot;Fetching the ball...&quot;)\n\nIn this class,¬†bark()¬†and¬†fetch()¬†are methods that represent the actions a dog can do.\n\nCREATING OBJECTS (INSTANCES) ¬ß\n\nTo use a class, you create objects (instances) from it. An object is a specific instance of a class.\n\nmy_dog = Dog()  # Creating an instance of the Dog class\n\nmy_dog¬†is now an object of the¬†Dog¬†class.\n\nACCESSING ATTRIBUTES AND METHODS ¬ß\n\nYou can access attributes and methods of an object using dot notation (object_name.attribute¬†or¬†object_name.method()).\n\nmy_dog.breed = &quot;Golden Retriever&quot;   # Setting the breed attribute\nmy_dog.age = 3                      # Setting the age attribute \nprint(&quot;My dog is a&quot;, my_dog.breed)  # Accessing the breed attribute\nmy_dog.bark()                       # Calling the bark method\n\nHere, we‚Äôve set the¬†breed¬†and¬†age¬†attributes and called the¬†bark()¬†method on¬†my_dog.\n\nCONSTRUCTOR METHOD (__INIT__) ¬ß\n\nThe¬†__init__¬†method is a special method in Python classes. It‚Äôs called when you create an object from the class and is used to initialize attributes.\n\nclass Dog:    \n    def __init__(self, breed, age):        \n        self.breed = breed        \n        self.age = age     \n \n    def bark(self):        \n        print(&quot;Woof! Woof!&quot;)\n\nWhen you create a¬†Dog¬†object, you need to provide values for¬†breed¬†and¬†age.\n\nmy_dog = Dog(&quot;Golden Retriever&quot;, 3)\n\nThis way, you can create a dog object with specific attributes during its creation.\n\nThat‚Äôs the basic idea of Python classes! Classes allow you to define a blueprint for creating objects with specific attributes and behaviors. They help you organize your code in a structured and reusable way, which is especially useful for building complex applications.\nType hints ¬ß\nType hints are a way in python to specify the intended type of a variable (not enforced just highly suggested). This works by having a colon, then the type declaration for each varaible/parameter/attribute. You can even include details about return types in functions with def function_name(parameter) -&gt; return_type For example:\nage = 21\n \ndef greet(name):\n¬† ¬†return f&quot;Hello {name}&quot;\n \n  \n \nclass Animal:\n¬† ¬†def __init__(self, name):\n¬† ¬† ¬† self.name = name\n \nCan be converted to:\nage:int = 21\n \ndef greet(name:str) -&gt; str:\n¬† ¬†return f&quot;Hello {name}&quot;\n \nclass Animal:\n¬† ¬†def __init__(self, name:str):\n¬† ¬† ¬† self.name:str = name\n \nThis gives an indication to people running your code which data types they should use. Along with this there are a few special types to keep in mind (most need to be imported from the typing module):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypeUsageExampleUnionTo indicate one type OR anotherA variable called age which can be a string or int could be given as age:Union[str,int] = &quot;Twenty Three&quot;LiteralThe avlue for the variable is literally one of the subscripted valuesx is 2, 4 or 6 only x:Literal[2,4,6]TupleA tuple is an imutable data type similar to a list, this can mean a tuple, or is used to indicate multiple return valuesThe function func() returns an int and a bool in that order def func() -&gt; Tuple[int, boolListA list is a collection. Collections can be subscripted to tell you what‚Äôs insideusers is a list of list of strings users:List[List[str]] = [[&quot;kieran&quot;],[&quot;James&quot;]]CallableThis means any object that has a __call__() method including functions (yes they are objects)Passing the function do_stuff() to time(func:Callable) so it can run it and time it time(do_stuff)\nEnforcing types ¬ß\nPython does not enforce types on function parameters. But you can make your own type enforcement by doing type comparisons. There are two ways to do this. The first is to use type() and compare to the class, for example:\n \ndef greet(name:str) -&gt; str:\n \n¬† if not type(name) == str:\n \n¬† ¬† raise ValueError(f&quot;{name} is not a string&quot;)\n \n¬† return f&quot;Hello {name}&quot;\n \n  \n \nclass Animal:\n \n¬† def __init__(self, name:str):\n \n¬† ¬† self.name:str = name\n \n  \n \ndef show_animal(animal:Animal):\n \n¬† if not type(animal) == Animal:\n \n¬† ¬† raise ValueError(f&quot;{animal} is not an Animal&quot;)\n \n¬† return f&quot;This animal is a {animal.name}&quot;\n \nThis method works ok, but it‚Äôs not the best. For example let‚Äôs say you have a class that extends the str class, it would fail that check:\n \nclass MyString(str):\n¬† def __init__(self,value:str):\n¬† ¬† if not type(value) == str:\n¬† ¬† ¬† raise ValueError(f&quot;{value} is not a string&quot;)\n¬† ¬† self.value = value\n \n¬† def __str__(self) -&gt; str:\n¬† ¬† return self.value ¬†\n \ndef greet(name:str) -&gt; str:\n¬† if not type(name) == str:\n¬† ¬† raise ValueError(f&quot;{name} is not a string&quot;)\n¬† return f&quot;Hello {name}&quot;\n \ngreet(MyString(&quot;Kieran&quot;)) # ValueError: Kieran is not a string\nIf we want to include subclasses we should use isinstance():\nclass MyString(str):\n¬† def __init__(self,value:str):\n¬† ¬† if not type(value) == str:\n¬† ¬† ¬† raise ValueError(f&quot;{value} is not a string&quot;)\n¬† ¬† self.value = value\n \n¬† def __str__(self) -&gt; str:\n¬† ¬† return self.value ¬†\n  \ndef greet(name:str) -&gt; str:\n¬† if not isinstance(name, str):\n¬† ¬† raise ValueError(f&quot;{name} is not a string&quot;)\n¬† return f&quot;Hello {name}&quot;\n \ngreet(MyString(&quot;Kieran&quot;)) # Hello Kieran\nHere are some good types you can use with isinstance() that are more general:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypeUsespackageNumberAll number types (int and float) work with itnumbers.NumberIterableAny type that can be iterated (a for loop works on it)IterableCallableAny type that can be called with parenthesis () (like function objects)Callable\nFor example:\n \nfrom numbers import Number\n \nprint(isinstance(1,Number)) # True\n \nprint(isinstance(1.2,Number)) # True\n \nprint(isinstance(1j,Number)) # True\n \n  \n \nfrom typing import Iterable\n \nprint(isinstance([],Iterable)) # True\n \nprint(isinstance(&quot;&quot;,Iterable)) # True\n \nprint(isinstance({},Iterable)) # True\n \n  \n \nfrom typing import Callable\n \n  \n \ndef greet(name:str) -&gt; str:\n \n¬† if not isinstance(name, str):\n \n¬† ¬† raise ValueError(f&quot;{name} is not a string&quot;)\n \n¬† return f&quot;Hello {name}&quot;\n \n  \n \nis_str = lambda s: isinstance(s, str) # Anonymous function\n \n  \n \nclass SquareNum:\n \n¬† ¬† def __init__(self, num:Number):\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† if not isinstance(num, Number):\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† raise ValueError(f&quot;{num} is not a Number&quot;)\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† self.num=num\n \n¬† ¬† def __call__(self) -&gt; Number:\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† return self.num *self.num\n \n  \n \nprint(isinstance(greet, Callable)) # True\n \nprint(isinstance(is_str, Callable)) # True\n \nprint(isinstance(SquareNum, Callable)) # True\n \n  \n \nWhile this works there are even better solutions. Pydantic is a python package that‚Äôs designed to help make data validation easy. The package helps with a few things, but mostly it helps solve a very annoying situation that happens constantly. When you get data from a server it will often come down as JSON, which will be converted to a python dictionary. These dictionaries can sometimes be very large. Here‚Äôs an example from their website:\n \n  \n \nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, PositiveInt\n \nclass User(BaseModel):\n \n¬† ¬† id: int ¬†\n \n¬† ¬† name: str = &#039;John Doe&#039; ¬†\n \n¬† ¬† signup_ts: datetime | None ¬†\n \n¬† ¬† tastes: dict[str, PositiveInt] ¬†\n \n  \n  \n \nexternal_data = {\n \n¬† ¬† &#039;id&#039;: 123,\n \n¬† ¬† &#039;signup_ts&#039;: &#039;2019-06-01 12:22&#039;, ¬†\n \n¬† ¬† &#039;tastes&#039;: {\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† &#039;wine&#039;: 9,\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† b&#039;cheese&#039;: 7, ¬†\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† &#039;cabbage&#039;: &#039;1&#039;, ¬†\n \n¬† ¬† },\n \n}\n \n  \n \nuser = User(**external_data) ¬†# Valid data, creates without issue NOTE: cabbage will have int(1) as value not str(&quot;1&quot;)\n \n  \n \nexternal_data = {&#039;id&#039;: &#039;not an int&#039;, &#039;tastes&#039;: {}} ¬†\n \n  \n \nUser(**external_data) ¬†# Invalid data, raises ValidationError\n \nThere are some more strict systems you can use if you want to enforce static typing (checking before you run code). The most popular is mypy, which throws errors if you try to run code that might have the wrong type. There‚Äôs also a newer library called pyre from meta (formerly facebook) which has a playground you can test with.\nThere‚Äôs a few others:\n\nGoogle Pytype\nMicrosoft Pyright\n\nPacking and Unpacking ¬ß\nWhen looking at collections you can ‚Äúunpack‚Äù them. This basically allows you to break them up into peices. For example:\n \nshopping_list = [&quot;eggs&quot;, &quot;ham&quot;, &quot;spam&quot;]\n \n  \n \nitem1, *remainders = shopping_list\n \n  \n \nprint(item1) # &#039;eggs&#039;\n \nprint(remainders) # [&#039;ham&#039;, &#039;spam&#039;]\n \nThe *remainder will ‚Äúunpack‚Äù values. This basically will ‚Äúconsume‚Äù collections. So item1 will access the first item in the list, and *remainders will unpack the remaining values into it. This can be used in a ton of situations, one major one is to unpack variables as parameters for functions. So for example let‚Äôs say someone has a tuple with coordinates coords = (x, y, z), and a function process_object(x, y, z), we can unpack the coords variable into the function:\n \ncoords = (x, y, z)\n \nprocess_object(*coords) # Same as process_object(x, y, z)\n \nYou can also use this to do the oposite and ‚Äúpack‚Äù values to allow for any number of parameters in a function (they will be put into a tuple):\n \ndef function(*parameters):\n \n¬† print(parameters)\n \n  \n \nfunction(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) # Prints: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n \nYou could then unpack them using *:\n \ndef function(*parameters):\n \n¬† print(*parameters)\n \n  \n \nfunction(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) # Prints: 1 2 3 4 5\n \nYou can also do this with dictionaries, but it‚Äôs more complex. It will allow you to get the keys and values from a dictionary. So one useful case is combining two dictionaries. For example let‚Äôs say you have some of your user info in one dict, and some in another that you want to combine:\n \nuser_info_1 = {\n \n¬† &quot;id&quot;: 1,\n \n¬† &quot;first_name&quot;: &quot;Dene&quot;,\n \n¬† &quot;last_name&quot;: &quot;Atwill&quot;,\n \n}\n \n  \n \nuser_info_2 = {\n \n¬† &quot;first_name&quot;: &quot;Dene&quot;,\n \n¬† &quot;email&quot;: &quot;datwill0@wordpress.com&quot;,\n \n¬† &quot;gender&quot;: &quot;Male&quot;,\n \n¬† &quot;ip_address&quot;: &quot;38.119.114.174&quot;\n \n}\n \n  \n \nuser_info = {**user_info_1, **user_info_2} # {&#039;id&#039;: 1, &#039;first_name&#039;: &#039;Dene&#039;, &#039;last_name&#039;: &#039;Atwill&#039;, &#039;email&#039;: &#039;datwill0@wordpress.com&#039;, &#039;gender&#039;: &#039;Male&#039;, &#039;ip_address&#039;: &#039;38.119.114.174&#039;}\n \nAdditionally this can be used to capture keyword arguments:\n \ndef function(**keyword_arguments):\n \n¬† print(keyword_arguments)\n \n  \n \nfunction(first_name= &quot;Dene&quot;, last_name=&quot;Atwill&quot;) # prints: {&#039;first_name&#039;: &#039;Dene&#039;, &#039;last_name&#039;: &#039;Atwill&#039;}\n \nOne great use for this is that it will allow you to write a function that allows you to pass config variables to a function, and you never have to change the function signatures to support new config variables!\nMagic/dunder methods ¬ß\nMagic/dunder methods are special types of methods that have some sort of special functionality in python. They‚Äôre often called magic methods, but they‚Äôre also called dunder (double underscore) methods because they all follow the patern __&lt;name&gt;__(). If you‚Äôve created a class before you‚Äôve actually used one before __init__(). Why can‚Äôt you have an initialize method just called init() or start()? Because __init__() is reserved as a name and is invoked when the code that creates an instance is called, which is why it works at all.\nThere are tons of other existing dunder methods to interact with various aspects of python.\nPrinting ¬ß\nFor example let‚Äôs say you have a User class, when you try to print it to the console you will get something like &lt;__main__.User object at 0x0000017CC4F90310&gt;. This isn‚Äôt super useful, so how could we instead override what prints when we call print on an object? Let‚Äôs say we have a name and age attribute, and we want to print &lt;name&gt;: &lt;age&gt;.\nThere is a built in magic method called __repr__() (I believe this is a short version of representation), this allows you to override the representation of the object (which is what‚Äôs printed). All we need to do is return a string with what we want to print, for example:\n \nclass User:\n \n¬† ¬† def __init__(self, name, age):\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† self.name = name\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† self.age = age\n \n¬† ¬† def __repr__(self):\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† return f&quot;{self.name}: {self.age}&quot;\n \n  \n \nprint(User(&quot;Kieran&quot;, 24)) # Prints: &quot;Kieran: 24&quot;\n \nConversions ¬ß\nThere are tons of magic methods you can define to convert between types. These will also apply in implicit conversions (i.e. when printing something a call to convert the object into a string happens). These methods tend to follow this pattern when defined:\n \ndef __&lt;type&gt;__(self):\n \n¬† return value\n \nWhere type is some type (i.e. str, int, float), and value is some value of that type (i.e. &quot;Class&quot;, 12, 3.14). Let‚Äôs say for example we have a class (MyValue), that class takes in an int or float, and then when casted to a string returns the word representation of a number (i.e. 1 would be &quot;One&quot;), and other number types (int,float return that type of data):\n \n# Define lists of words for numbers 1-19 and multiples of 10 up to 90 (used in string conversion)\n \nones = [&quot;Zero&quot;, &quot;One&quot;, &quot;Two&quot;, &quot;Three&quot;, &quot;Four&quot;, &quot;Five&quot;, &quot;Six&quot;, &quot;Seven&quot;, &quot;Eight&quot;, &quot;Nine&quot;, &quot;Ten&quot;, &quot;Eleven&quot;, &quot;Twelve&quot;, &quot;Thirteen&quot;, &quot;Fourteen&quot;, &quot;Fifteen&quot;, &quot;Sixteen&quot;, &quot;Seventeen&quot;, &quot;Eighteen&quot;, &quot;Nineteen&quot;]\n \ntens = [&quot;&quot;, &quot;Ten&quot;, &quot;Twenty&quot;, &quot;Thirty&quot;, &quot;Forty&quot;, &quot;Fifty&quot;, &quot;Sixty&quot;, &quot;Seventy&quot;, &quot;Eighty&quot;, &quot;Ninety&quot;]\n \n  \n \nclass MyValue:\n \n¬† ¬† def __init__(self, value):\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† if not type(value) in [float, int]:\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† # Try to cast invalid values into a float\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† value = float(value)\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† self.value = value\n \n  \n \n¬† ¬† def __int__(self):\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† # Returns a int representation of the object\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† return int(self.value)\n \n  \n \n¬† ¬† def __float__(self):\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† # Returns a float representation of the object\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† return float(self.value)\n \n¬† ¬† ###### Defining helper functions to help with the string conversion ######\n \n  \n \n¬† ¬† def convert_less_than_hundred(self, number):\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† # Function to convert a number less than 100 to text\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† if number &lt;

This allows you to overwrite what happens when you use an operator (+, -, /, //, % etc.). To do this you just use the pattern of using the operator name with one argument and a return:\n \nclass DoMath:\n \n¬† def __init__(self, value):\n \n¬† ¬† self.value = value\n \n  \n \n¬† def __add__(self, value):\n \n¬† ¬† return self.value + value\n \n  \n  \n \nprint(DoMath(5) + 3)\n \nOther Operators:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction nameOperator-__sub__()-__mul__()*__floordiv__()¬†//__truediv__()/__mod__()%__pow__()**\nKeep in mind you can also add an i in front of the function name to change the behaviour with assignment operators. For example __iadd__() will override behaviour for +=\nLogical Comparisons ¬ß\nLogical operators allows you to do logical operator overloading. This allows you to overwrite what happens when you use an operator (&lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, == etc.). To do this you just use the pattern of using the operator name with one argument and a return (must be a bool):\n \nclass CheckLessThan:\n \n¬† def __init__(self, value):\n \n¬† ¬† self.value = value\n \n  \n \n¬† def __lt__(self, value):\n \n¬† ¬† return self.value &lt; value\n \n  \n \nprint(DoMath(5) &lt; 3)\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction nameOperator__lt__()&lt;__le__()¬†&lt;=__eq__()¬†==__ne__()¬†!=__ge__()¬†&gt;=\nClass/data-structure type magic methods ¬ß\nThere are also several other dunder methods that exist for creating special types of objects including:\n\n__call__() for callable classes\n\n¬† - Be careful with this\n\n__getitem__() &amp; __setitem__() for key-value pairs (see example in this post)\n\n¬† - hash-maps\n¬† - dictionaries\n¬† - etc.\n\n__len__() for container-like structures (what len() uses)\n\n¬† - lists\n¬† - arrays\n¬† - linked-list\n¬† - doubly-linked-lists\n\n__enter__() &amp; __exit__() for context managers\n\n¬† - files\n¬† - sockets\n\n\n__iter__() &amp; __next__() for iterators\n\n\nCreating your own dunder methods ¬ß\nWhy not create your own magic methods? If you‚Äôre writing a program it seems ‚Äúpythonic‚Äù to create your own magic methods that can be used by an API (I did this for this project, where I created __html__() to turn a class into HTML). There is an implicit danger with doing this though.\nThe PSF (group that makes python) reserves the right to create whatever of these dunder methods they want. This means something like __html__() if it ever gets imlemented in python natively will break my app. So if you rely on this in your programs then python can completely break your program at any point, so you need to be careful.\nHigher order functions\nA higher order function will allow you to run code before and after a function executes. To explain how this works you need to understand that EVERYTHING in python is an object, including functions. If I look at this example:\n \ndef foo(a, b):\n \n¬† return b-a\n \n  \n \nprint(type(foo)) # &lt;class &#039;function&#039;&gt;\n \nWe can see the type of foo is the class function. Specifically it‚Äôs a class that runs the function body when __call__() is called. Adding a parenthesis to the end of a class causes this __call__() to happen, so foo() is a shortform for foo.__call__(). So since it‚Äôs a class we can pass it as an object the same way we could with other classes and call it later. This can help us solve some more awkward issues like timing functions.\nLet‚Äôs say we want a function we can use to measure how long a function takes to run, the basic code would look like this:\n \nimport time\n \n  \n \ndef foo(a, b):\n \n¬† time.sleep(.3)\n \n¬† return b-a\n \n  \n \nbefore = time.time()\n \nfoo(1,2)\n \nafter = time.time()\n \n  \n \ntime_taken = after-before\n \n  \n \nprint(f&quot;foo() took {time_taken}&quot;) # foo() took 0.30090832710266113\n \nSo turning this approach into a function we get:\n \nimport time\n \n  \n \ndef foo(a, b):\n \n¬† time.sleep(.3)\n \n¬† return b-a\n \n  \n \ndef time_function(function_to_time):\n \n¬† before = time.time()\n \n¬† function_to_time(1,2)\n \n¬† after = time.time()\n \n¬† time_taken = after-before\n \n¬† return time_taken\n \n  \n \nprint(f&quot;foo() took {time_function(foo)}&quot;) # foo() took 0.30090832710266113\n \nBut, how do we allow for people to pass arguments to the function? We could hardcode passing in 2 parameters, but what if we want to time a function with 3, or 4 parameters? We can allow a function to accept an arbitrary number of arguments to a function using *:\n \nimport time\n \n  \n \ndef foo(a, b):\n \n¬† time.sleep(.3)\n \n¬† return b-a\n \n  \n \ndef time_function(function_to_time, *args):\n \n¬† before = time.time()\n \n¬† function_to_time(*args)\n \n¬† after = time.time()\n \n¬† time_taken = after-before\n \n¬† return time_taken\n \n  \n \nprint(f&quot;foo() took {time_function(foo, 1, 2)}&quot;) # foo() took 0.30090832710266113\n \n*args in this case allows us to pass any number of arguments (see Packing and Unpacking for details and details about using keyword/named arguments).\nDecorators ¬ß\nDecorators are an extra layer of syntactic sugar that allow you to make higher order functions easier to work with. If we take our example of a timing function like this:\n \nimport time\n \n  \n \ndef foo(a, b):\n \n¬† time.sleep(.3)\n \n¬† return b-a\n \n  \n \ndef time_function(function_to_time, *args):\n \n¬† before = time.time()\n \n¬† function_to_time(*args)\n \n¬† after = time.time()\n \n¬† time_taken = after-before\n \n¬† return time_taken\n \n  \n \nprint(f&quot;foo() took {time_function(foo, 1, 2)}&quot;) # foo() took 0.30090832710266113\n \nFrom this lets say we want to always time the foo() function (for example if it was a benchmark function). We can do this by using an @ and the function name we want to wrap, and put it before the definition. In order for this to work there is an awkward step, we need to create an inner function, which runs our function:\n \nimport time\n \n  \n \ndef time_function(function_to_time):\n \n¬† def dummy_function(*args):\n \n¬† ¬† before = time.time()\n \n¬† ¬† function_to_time(*args)\n \n¬† ¬† after = time.time()\n \n¬† ¬† time_taken = after-before\n \n¬† ¬† return time_taken\n \n¬† return dummy_function\n \n  \n \n@time_function\n \ndef foo(a, b):\n \n¬† time.sleep(.3)\n \n¬† return b-a\n \n  \n \nprint(f&quot;foo() took {foo(1, 2)}&quot;) # foo() took 0.30090832710266113\n \nSo what just happened? When foo() runs time_function and passes itself as an instance to time_function(). Which is a fancy way to say foo() passes itself and it‚Äôs arguments to time_function(). From there we must create a closure to get our variables back. So dummy_function() exists to capture *args (positional arguments to the function [in our case 1, 2]).\nSo all in all we are running foo() with it‚Äôs arguments inside dummy_function(), we are then returning the time taken from the function, and with our decorator (the time_function()) we are returning the dummy_function to be called. So foo(1,2) calls dummy_function(1,2) and returns it‚Äôs time_taken.\nThis works great‚Ä¶ but keep in mind that when we called foo() we got the result of time_function() NOT the function call. If we wanted the value of the function call we need to capture it in time_function(), and return it instead:\n \nimport time\n \n  \n \ndef time_function(function_to_time):\n \n¬† def dummy_function(*args):\n \n¬† ¬† before = time.time()\n \n¬† ¬† result = function_to_time(*args)\n \n¬† ¬† after = time.time()\n \n¬† ¬† time_taken = after-before\n \n¬† ¬† print(f&quot;{function_to_time.__name__}() took {time_taken}&quot;) # foo() took 0.30090832710266113\n \n¬† ¬† return result\n \n¬† return dummy_function\n \n  \n \n@time_function\n \ndef foo(a, b):\n \n¬† time.sleep(.3)\n \n¬† return b-a\n \n  \n \nfoo(1,2) # Returns 1\n \nIf we wanted to return both, we could:\n \nimport time\n \n  \n \ndef time_function(function_to_time):\n \n¬† def dummy_function(*args):\n \n¬† ¬† before = time.time()\n \n¬† ¬† result = function_to_time(*args)\n \n¬† ¬† after = time.time()\n \n¬† ¬† time_taken = after-before\n \n¬† ¬† return result, time_taken\n \n¬† return dummy_function\n \n  \n \n@time_function\n \ndef foo(a, b):\n \n¬† time.sleep(.3)\n \n¬† return b-a\n \n  \n \nresult, time_taken = foo(1,2) # Returns (1, 0.30090832710266113)\n \nprint(f&quot;foo() took {time_taken} and had a result of {result}&quot;) # foo() took 0.30090832710266113 and had a result of 1\n \nProperties (getters and setters) ¬ß\nProperties are a method in python to enforce the getter-setter pattern. This is more popular in languages like Java, but essentially instead of having tons of attributes that you access directly you have methods that control access to, and modification of certain attributes. This is useful for various scenarios such as:\n\n\nEnsuring a provided value is within a range when trying to set an attribute to the value\n\n\nIf a value is taken from a remote service then ensuring it is up to date when accessing\n\n\nIn asynchronus contexts it can be used to ensure locks and safe concurrent access/writes\n\n\nLet‚Äôs say for example you have an app that displays a dashboard about a city, this includes the name, population and temperature. When people access the population and temperature you want to access external services (like the city registry for population, and a weather monitor for remperature). So every time you want a bit of code to run to make sure the value being accessed is up to date. To do this you can make the attributes for temperature and population into properties. Then for each you will need a property declaration (the getter), and a setter. The getter will be used when people call City.temperature or City.population, and the setter will run when City.temperature = value or City.population = value is called.\n \nMINIMUM_TEMPERATURE_CELCIUS = -273 # Absolute zero in celcius\n \n  \n \nclass City:\n \n¬† ¬† def __init__(self, name, population, temperature=0):\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† self.name = name\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† self.population = population\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† self.temperature = temperature\n \n  \n \n¬† ¬† @property\n \n¬† ¬† def population(self) -&gt; int:\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† api_result = 1_000_000 # A fake call to the external API\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† self._population = api_result\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† return self._population\n \n  \n \n¬† ¬† @temperature.setter\n \n¬† ¬† def population(self, value):\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† # No special processing\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† self._population = value\n \n  \n \n¬† ¬† @property\n \n¬† ¬† def temperature(self):\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† print(&quot;Getting value...&quot;)\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† return self._temperature\n \n  \n \n¬† ¬† @temperature.setter\n \n¬† ¬† def temperature(self, value):\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† print(&quot;Setting value...&quot;)\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† if value &lt; MINIMUM_TEMPERATURE_CELCIUS:\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† raise ValueError(f&quot;Temperature below {MINIMUM_TEMPERATURE_CELCIUS} is not possible&quot;)\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† self._temperature = value\n \nSo in this case temperature() and population() are the getters, which means that when you try to access City.temperature this function is called and the result is returned. Syntax wise you need to append an underscore to access the current value. Once you have declared a property, you can then create a setter as a decorator, which would be the functions that also take in value as a parameter.\nIterators ¬ß\nWhen you use a for loop in python there is something interesting happening under the hood. Iterators are a special type of class that implements the iterator protocol. The protocol operates on classes that have two magic methods. This is what is used when you iterate. For example take this for loop:\n \nshopping_list = [&quot;eggs&quot;, &quot;ham&quot;, &quot;spam&quot;]\n \n  \n \nfor item in shopping_list:\n \n¬† print(item)\n \nThis can functionally be done the same with:\n \nindex = 0\n \n  \n \nwhile index &lt; len(shopping_list):\n \n¬† print(shopping_list[index])\n \n¬† index += 1\n \nYou will notice that essentially our loop calls the next item, until there are no more items. This is what the iterator is based on, it asks you to tell it what to call on each iteration (__iter__()), and then on each iteration it will call that Iterable‚Äôs __next__() function until a StopIteration exception is raised.\nCreating your own Iterator ¬ß\nWith that knowledge let‚Äôs create an iterator to understand how this works:\n \nfrom typing import List\n \n  \n \nclass ShoppingList:\n \n¬† def __init__(self, items:List[str]):\n \n¬† ¬† self.items = items\n \n¬† ¬† self.current_index = 0\n \n  \n \n¬† def __iter__(self):\n \n¬† ¬† return self # Shopping list is an Iterator and an Iterable\n \n¬† def __next__(self):\n \n¬† ¬† if self.current_index &lt; len(self.items):\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† return_value = self.items[self.current_index]\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† self.current_index += 1\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† return return_value\n \n¬† ¬† raise StopIteration\n \n  \n \nfor item in ShoppingList([&quot;Eggs&quot;, &quot;Ham&quot;, &quot;Spam&quot;]):\n \n¬† print(item)\n \nThis means you can also make Iterators out of things that don‚Äôt have a defined length. For example let‚Äôs say you have a database you‚Äôre looping through, but data is coming in while you‚Äôre looping. Instead of storing the current state and iterating over that, you can continuously keep iterating until a StopIteration is raised!\nList comprehensions ¬ß\nA list comprehension syntactically shorter way to produce a list of values with a simple calculation. It is intended to replace the design pattern of:\n\n\ninstantiating an empty list\n\n\nIterate and store values in the list\n\n\nreturn or use list values.\n\n\nFor example:\n \nresult = [] # 1. Initialize empty list\n \n  \n \n# 2. Iterate and store values in the list\n \nfor number in range(10): # Square numbers from 0-9 and add them to the result list\n \n¬† ¬† result.append(number**2)\n \n  \n \nprint(result) # 3. Return or use list values\n \nCan be shortened to:\n \nresult = [number ** 2 for number in range(10)] # Steps 1-2\n \n  \n \nprint(result) # 3. Return or use list values\n \nwhich produces:\n \n[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]\n \nIt does exactly the same as the above example, it is just shorter. The basic syntax is [operation for variable in iterable] Were operation is the calculation (or function) being run, variable is the name for the temporary iteration variable made, and iterable is some form of iterable (list, generator, set etc.). We can also do this conditionally, so for example if we wanted to only include even numbers we could do:\n \nevens = [number for number in range(10) if number %2 == 0]\n \nprint(evens) # [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]\n \nAnd we can do an if-else statement using:\n \nevens = [&quot;even&quot; if number %2 == 0 else &quot;odd&quot; for number in range(10)]\n \nprint(evens) # [&#039;even&#039;, &#039;odd&#039;, &#039;even&#039;, &#039;odd&#039;, &#039;even&#039;, &#039;odd&#039;, &#039;even&#039;, &#039;odd&#039;, &#039;even&#039;, &#039;odd&#039;]\n \nGenerators ¬ß\nA generator is a type of iterator. This will allow you to make an iterator out of results of functions. For example:\n \ndef lots_of_numbers():\n \n¬† for number in range(10_000_000):\n \n¬† ¬† yield number\n \n  \n \nfor number in lots_of_numbers:\n \n¬† print(number)\n \nEssentially you can iterate over results 1 at a time. The question is why? Efficiency.\nIn order to iterate over 10 million numbers you would normally need to put those numbers in a list, store that list and then iterate over it. This means that data needs to be stored somewhere while iterating. With a generator the value is generated when it‚Äôs needed, and then is ‚Äúpaused‚Äù until next() is called on it again. So if instead of a full loop I did something like:\n \ndef lots_of_numbers():\n \n¬† for number in range(10_000_000):\n \n¬† ¬† yield number\n \n  \n \nnums = lots_of_numbers()\n \n  \n \nprint(next(nums)) # prints 0\n \nprint(next(nums)) # prints 1\n \nWhich we can run while using essentially 0 memory. We can also use generators to do memory efficient returns of different values. For example let‚Äôs say we need to get a bunch of data from an API but don‚Äôt want to have to store it all we could turn the response into a generator and only process the results one at a time. Lets say for example that get_user_orders() sends back a JSON string that we‚Äôre storing in a file:\n \ndef get_user_info():\n \n¬† yield get_user_name() # &quot;kieran&quot;\n \n¬† yield get_user_orders() # Returns a large JSON string\n \n¬† yield get_user_age() # 24\n \n  \n \nuser_info = get_user_info()\n \n  \n \nprint(next(user_info)) # kieran\n \nprint(next(user_info)) # prints a large JSON string\n \nprint(next(user_info)) # 24\n \nThis means we only use the memory for get_user_orders() when the second next() is called, compared to something more traditional like this:\n \ndef get_user_info():\n \n¬† return {\n \n¬† ¬† &quot;name&quot;: get_user_name(),\n \n¬† ¬† &quot;orders&quot;: get_user_orders(),\n \n¬† ¬† &quot;age&quot;: get_user_age()\n \n¬† }\n \n  \n \nuser_info = get_user_info()\n \n  \n \nprint(user_info) # prints a large JSON string\n \nWe need to store it in RAM the whole time!\nDataclasses ¬ß\nDataclasses are a special way to define classes in python. They help make classes more efficient, but have some caveats (that I find are positives), namely all your attributes must be defined with type hints. For example here is a User class the typical python way:\n \nclass User:\n \n¬† ¬†def __init__(self, name, age, birthday):\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† self.name = name\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† self.age = age\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† self.birthday = birthday\n \nNow here is the same class in a dataclass:\n \nfrom datetime import datetime\n \nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\n \n  \n \n@dataclass\n \nclass User:\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† name: str\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† age:int\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† birthday:datetime\n \nThe handy thing about this is that the birthday attribute was not clear in the original example. It could have been a 3 value tuple for year, month, day ((1998,10,28)), a formatted string &quot;28-10-1998&quot; or any other types. But now users know what type they should use (this is not enforced).\nIf you need to run code after a class instance is created you can use __post_init__(self).\n__post_init__() ¬ß\nThis is a magic method that runs after your dataclass instance is setup. So for example maybe you want to do some birthday checking to make sure someone‚Äôs birthday matches their age, and they aren‚Äôt saying they‚Äôre over 200 years old:\n \nfrom datetime import datetime\n \nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\n \n  \n \n@dataclass\n \nclass User:\n \n¬† ¬† name: str\n \n¬† ¬† age:int\n \n¬† ¬† birthday:datetime\n \n  \n \n¬† ¬† def __post_init__(self):\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† if self.age &gt; 200:\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† raise ValueError(&quot;You can&#039;t be over 200 years old &gt;:(&quot;)\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† if ((datetime.now().year - self.birthday.year) != self.age) and ((datetime.now().year - self.birthday.year) != self.age+1):\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† raise ValueError(&quot;Your birthday doesn&#039;t match your age&quot;)\n \nprint(User(&quot;Kieran&quot;, 24, datetime(1998,10,29)))\n \n  \n \n# Invalid\n \nprint(User(&quot;Kieran&quot;, 24, datetime(1864,10,5)))\n \nprint(User(&quot;Kieran&quot;, 400, datetime(2023-400,10,5)))\n \nClassVar‚Äôs ¬ß\nA class variable is a variable that exists as part of a class not part of an instance. This means each instance has the same value because it comes from the class they come from. This is handy in many situations such as keeping track of isntances that are created:\n \nfrom __future__ import annotations\n \nfrom typing import ClassVar, List\n \nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\n \n  \n \n@dataclass\n \nclass Slide:\n \n¬† ¬† content: str\n \n¬† ¬† slides: ClassVar[List[Slide]] = []\n \n  \n \n¬† ¬† def __post_init__(self):\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† Slide.slides.append(self)\n \n  \n  \n \nSlide(&quot;Hello World&quot;)\n \nSlide(&quot;World Hello&quot;)\n \nSlide(&quot;HeLlO WoRlD&quot;)\n \n  \n \nprint(Slide.slides) # [Slide(content=&#039;Hello World&#039;), Slide(content=&#039;World Hello&#039;), Slide(content=&#039;HeLlO WoRlD&#039;)]\n \nSlide.slides will now have a list of every class instance that is created, but keep in mind this means that the instances will NEVER be deleted unless you clear them out. So you might end up wasting a ton of memory. You can resolve this by having some sort of Slide.delete() method to remove itself from the list when removed:\n \nfrom __future__ import annotations\n \nfrom typing import ClassVar, List\n \nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\n \n@dataclass\n \nclass Slide:\n \n¬† ¬† content: str\n \n¬† ¬† slides: ClassVar[List[Slide]] = []\n \n  \n \n¬† ¬† def __post_init__(self):\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† Slide.slides.append(self)\n \n¬† ¬† def delete(self):\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† Slide.slides.remove(self)\n \n  \n \nSlide(&quot;Hello World&quot;)\n \nq = Slide(&quot;World Hello&quot;)\n \nSlide(&quot;HeLlO WoRlD&quot;)\n \n  \n \nprint(Slide.slides) # [Slide(content=&#039;Hello World&#039;), Slide(content=&#039;World Hello&#039;), Slide(content=&#039;HeLlO WoRlD&#039;)]\n \nq.delete()\n \nprint(Slide.slides) # [Slide(content=&#039;Hello World&#039;), Slide(content=&#039;HeLlO WoRlD&#039;)]\n \nFields ¬ß\nSome types of attributes in dataclasses need to be instantiated in more complex ways. These types require you to use field(). For example most lists will need you to use a function to instantiate it:\n \nfrom typing import ClassVar, List, Any\n \nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\n \n  \n \n@dataclass\n \nclass Student:\n \n¬† name:str\n \n¬† age:int\n \n¬† student_id: str\n \n  \n \ndef create_empty_list() -&gt; List[Any]:\n \n¬† return []\n \n  \n \n@dataclass\n \nclass School:\n \n¬† students: List[Student] = field(default_factory=create_empty_list)\n \nSo in this case the field() function takes in a default_factory which is a Callable. This is a great case for using anonymous functions/lambdas:\n \nfrom typing import ClassVar, List, Any\n \nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\n \n  \n \n@dataclass\n \nclass Student:\n \n¬† name:str\n \n¬† age:int\n \n¬† student_id: str\n \n  \n \n@dataclass\n \nclass School:\n \n¬† students: List[Student] = field(default_factory=lambda: [])\n \nContext managers ¬ß\nThere are many situations where you will want to have an object exist temporarily, and that object must run some code to ‚Äúclose‚Äù it. The most common case is files. Check out this python code:\n \nf = open(&quot;my_file.txt&quot;, &quot;w+&quot;)\n \n  \n \nf.write(&quot;some content&quot;)\n \n  \n \n... # more code\n \n  \n \nf.write(&quot;some content&quot;)\n \n  \n \n... # more code\n \n  \n \nf.write(&quot;some content&quot;)\n \nYou will notice we opened the file, wrote to it a few times, and never closed it. Lets say the code between one of the writes took a while, and someone else wanted to write to the file, what happens? In the best case the won‚Äôt be allowed to write to the file, in the worst case the changes will trample over each other, or just cause a file corruption in some cases (like if an error happens mid-write). This is why we have to close the file between writes:\n \nf = open(&quot;my_file.txt&quot;, &quot;w+&quot;)\n \nf.write(&quot;some content&quot;)\n \nf.close()\n \n  \n \n... # more code\n \n  \n \nf = open(&quot;my_file.txt&quot;, &quot;w+&quot;)\n \nf.write(&quot;some content&quot;)\n \nf.close()\n \n  \n \n... # more code\n \n  \n \nf = open(&quot;my_file.txt&quot;, &quot;w+&quot;)\n \nf.write(&quot;some content&quot;)\n \nf.close()\n \nThis is very tedious, and doesn‚Äôt guarentee you will always remember to close your file. This is where context managers come in. A context manager is an object that defines an ‚Äúopening‚Äù, and ‚Äúclose‚Äù and will even handle if an error is raised to make sure the file is still closed anyway. You can technically call these manually, but python has a with statement that makes this easier:\n \nwith open(&quot;my_file.txt&quot;, &quot;w+&quot;) as f:\n \n¬† f.write(&quot;some content&quot;)\n \n  \n \n... # more code\n \n  \n \nwith open(&quot;my_file.txt&quot;, &quot;w+&quot;) as f:\n \n¬† f.write(&quot;some content&quot;)\n \n  \n \n... # more code\n \n  \n \nwith open(&quot;my_file.txt&quot;, &quot;w+&quot;) as f:\n \n¬† f.write(&quot;some content&quot;)\n \nNow f only exists in the indentation level up from the with statement! Outside that indentation level it has either not yet been opened, or been closed!\nThese are implemented with magic/dunder methods.\nCreating your own context managers ¬ß\nTo create a context manager you just need a __enter__() and __exit__() method. For example:\n \nclass MyContextManager:\n \n¬† def __init__(self):\n \n¬† ¬† ...\n \n¬† def __enter__(self):\n \n¬† ¬† print(&#039;Opened&#039;)\n \n¬† ¬† return self\n \n¬† def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, exc_traceback):\n \n¬† ¬† ¬† print(&#039;Closed&#039;)\n \n  \n \n¬† def do_stuff(self):\n \n¬† ¬† print(&quot;Hello&quot;)\n \n  \n \nwith MyContextManager() as m:\n \n¬† m.do_stuff()\n \n__enter__() is self-explanatory, but __exit__() has some interesting parameters. Like I said the method will be called even if there is an error thrown. Those parameters tell you if an error occurred (if no error occurs all 3 are None):\n\n\nexc_type; The type of the error (i.e. ValueError)\n\n\nexc_value; The instance of the exception raised\n\n\nexc_traceback; The traceback object related to the error\n\n\nLambdas\nLambdas are a way in python to declare anonymous functions. What this means is you can assign a function call to a variable. So for example let‚Äôs take the simplest case, a function that takes in a name and returns a greeting string using the name:\n \ndef generate_greeting(name: str):\n \n¬† ¬†return f&quot;Hello {name}&quot;\n \nWe can make this a lambda like this:\n \ngenerate_greeting = lambda name: f&quot;Hello {name}&quot;\n \nLambdas follow the form of:\n \nlambda arguments: # Function body\n \nLambdas always return whatever value is evaluated in the function body. So since we evaluated the string, we get the string back at the end. We can then call it the same way:\n \ngenerate_greeting(&quot;Kieran&quot;) # &quot;Hello Kieran&quot;\n \nThis comes in handy in cases where something needs a Callable objet, but you don‚Äôt need to call it more than once. One example of this is in dataclasses. For some data types (like Lists) you need to provide a Callable object (object with a __call__() funtion) to initialize an attribute that is a list. So you can do this with a lambda that returns an empty list like so:\n \nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\n \n  \n \nempty_list = lambda : []\n \n  \n \n@dataclass\n \nclass Student:\n \n¬† ¬†grades:List[int] = field(default_factory=empty_list) # Initialize Student.grades to an empty list\n \nAdditional Resources ¬ß\n\nInside the Python GIL.

These terms convey the intent, permission &amp; motivations behind the way someone is hacking.\nLegality ¬ß\nAll hacking (including white hat) can be illegal in various ways, so don‚Äôt think just because you pick one of these that you‚Äôre free of legal scrutiny 1 2. This changes over time, and per country, but you should look into your legal risk before doing any work on systems in particular for any situation you should:\n\nAsk permission first before trying an exploit.\n\nImportantly you need to get in writing that you‚Äôre allowed to do what you‚Äôre doing. Even if someone hires you there should be a record, or they can say they never gave you permission.\n\n\nDisclose all exploits\n\nIf you come across an exploit while intentionally or unintentionally using an application you should disclose it. The two common types are responsible disclosure, and full3. Many places will have bug bounty programs exactly for this4 5\n\n\nDO NOT COLLECT DATA\n\nIf you are able to get data from a system do not store it. Storing stolen data is illegal in pretty much every country, especially user data\n\n\n\nDoing all of this does not guarantee you legal immunity, it‚Äôs just the best practices to avoid most legal issues. Some countries have stronger stances on this 6 7 than others8 and that will effect legality a lot as well.\nTypes of Disclosures ¬ß\nIt‚Äôs important to note when disclosing bugs there are 2 main types, public/full and responsible/private. Their names should give you some indication, but essentially a full disclosure is a disclosure of a bug publicly 9 10 11. The philosophy of this is that people deserve to know their devices are vulnerable. By disclosing publicly it forces the company to resolve the issues, unlike private disclosures, which can often take years and can lead to ‚Äúcatch and kill‚Äù.\nPrivate/responsible disclosures instead will report directly to the hardware/software developer directly so they can fix it without the knowledge of the public. This is often done through bug bounty programs where people are paid to find bugs. This also has the benefit of not allowing black hat hackers to use a bug while the developer is patching it.\nThere is a more in depth article on the ethics here.\nWhite Hat ¬ß\nThese are typically considered the ‚Äúgood guys‚Äù, the intention is to discover security vulnerabilities to help the affected systems, and importantly doing all this while they have permission to do so. White hat hackers would include people who are part of security analysis teams\nJust because white hat hackers have permission does not always mean they are free from legal issues. For example a polish train service hired hackers to look into issues with a train when their warranty expired, and they are now being threatened by the manufacturer12. Likewise agents working for governments of one country do not have permission from other countries for their work, and may find themselves being charged if they enter those countries.\nExamples ¬ß\n\nCompanies that offer to do paid penetration testing\n\nPenetration Testing Services | Pentesting | HackerOne\nPenetration Testing Services for Security | BreachLock\nWhite-hacking Services - White Hat Hacker Company - Enterprise Security - Kiss Software\n\n\nPolish Train DRM\n\nTechnical Details\nAdditional Sources, and legal threats\n\nTrains were designed to break down after third-party repairs, hackers find | Ars Technica\nHackers Hit With Legal Threats After They Fixed a ‚ÄòBricked‚Äô Polish Train (gizmodo.com)\n\n\n\n\n\nGrey Hat ¬ß\nThis is essentially where you are hacking ‚Äúfor good‚Äù, in a legally or ethically ambiguous way. This is someone for example who is working on a system without explicit permission. This means that you are operating in a ‚Äúgrey-area‚Äù, since you don‚Äôt intend to do something wrong, but this doesn‚Äôt mean you are in the clear.\nSome countries will ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù grey hat hacking to white hat hacking if people follow responsible disclosure paths 6 13. These laws change by country, but in some countries it is ‚Äúsafe‚Äù to test an exploit so long as you can demonstrate it‚Äôs sole purpose was to then disclose it to the company. Different countries have varying rules on this, but generally if you write up a disclosure (like a CVE) you can avoid the legal consequences. Realistically you should just go the ‚Äúwhite hat‚Äù approach first, and reach out before testing, however if you accidentally find a vulnerability in many cases you should be protected so long as you disclose it to the company that makes the software or hardware you‚Äôre using.\nExamples ¬ß\n\nGoogle cloud hacking\n\nGoogle Online Security Blog: Google Cloud Awards $313,337 in 2022 VRP Prizes (googleblog.com)\nHacking Google Cloud?

This is people who are hacking illegally with the intention to be paid to exploit, and or sell exploits. Basically all forms of black hat hacking are illegal, including the less obvious forms like social engineering. It‚Äôs also important to be aware that in some countries even purchasing vulnerabilities can be considered illegal.\nExamples ¬ß\n\nNHS ransomware attacks\n\nNHS ransomware attack spreads worldwide - PMC (nih.gov)\nUK battles hacking wave as ransomware gang claims ‚Äòbiggest ever‚Äô NHS breach | TechCrunch\nNHS ransomware attack: what happened and how bad is it? | Cybercrime | The Guardian\n\n\nEbay 2016 XSS attacks\n\nXSS Flaw Exposed eBay Users to Phishing Attacks - SecurityWeek\nHackers still exploiting eBay‚Äôs stored XSS vulnerabilities in 2017 | Netcraft\neBay Falls Victim to Cross-Site Scripting Attack (bitdefender.com)\n\n\nSammy worm\n\nThe MySpace Worm that Changed the Internet Forever (vice.com)\nThe Tale of Samy The Worm..

The purpose of this project is to be a knowledge base for all things computer science. Most of this is information I have come across and used. The information is broken up into various sections by field to make it easy to find things, but also don‚Äôt be afraid to use the search bar since the site has full-text search to make finding whatever you need as easy as possible!\nNavigation ¬ß\nWhen navigating through to any new topic in the knowledge base I would recommend checking out the page labelled üå±Basics/Intro in each section.  From there there is also (on desktop) a graph view in the top right (should be at the bottom of the page on mobile) to see which pages are related to the current page. Many times the related pages are in different sections and are worth checking out when they come up. Additionally at the bottom of most pages there is an additional resources section which includes references to alternate explanations, expansions on the topic, or examples of the topic in the real world.\nAbout Me ¬ß\nHi üëã, I‚Äôm Kieran.\nI‚Äôm currently a computer science student with a minor in philosophy at the University of Calgary in Canada. I‚Äôve been developing since I started my degree professionally as a freelancer, doing enterprise work on internship and a full-time employee at my university. When I can I also do open source work (including this site). If you‚Äôre interested in some of my other projects check out some of the links in the footer of the site!"}}
