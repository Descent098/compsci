    <description>When developing software you have an important choice to make. Should users be able to see the source code to the program youâ€™re asking them to run? Should you be able to know the internals of whatâ€™s happening in your computer? Much of the software we used today is closed source and proprietary, meaning we donâ€™t know how it works, since we canâ€™t view the source code.</description>

    <description>When we count we traditionally use base 10. Base 10 gives us 10 values before we shift digits. We go from 0-9, and then we shift 1 digit left, and start from 0 in the far right column again: 0 1 2 .</description>

    <description>A cache is basically a system where you store something you know you will need for later. Imagine you work in a bakery.
