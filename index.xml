    <description> Info History informs some of the technical information, as such this section will include technical info about linux, and some history. This I think is the best way to talk about linux &amp; unix since often the history informs the technical decisions.</description>

    <description>This is the good old operating system you know and love. This is where applications, your desktop, and %90 of computing is done. (5) The Laymanâ€™s Guide to Linux: User Space - YouTube (Covers most things at once, but I would recommend doing other sections first then come back to this video) Package managers These systems are designed to help a user manage packages (applications and services that run on an OS).</description>

    <description>When we count we traditionally use base 10. Base 10 gives us 10 values before we shift digits. We go from 0-9, and then we shift 1 digit left, and start from 0 in the far right column again: 0 1 2 ..</description>

    <description>A cache is basically a system where you store something you know you will need for later. Imagine you work in a bakery. If you wait until someone orders a loaf of bread to cook it, then now every person who comes into your store has to wait for you to cook the loaf before they can leave.</description>

    <description>Encoding just means a way to take a set of information in one format, and convert or represent it to another format. You can imagine the same concept (a boat, a sandwhich etc.) being encoded in different languages (spanish, english etc.).</description>

    <description>Hashing is a process where you take some sort of input data and use a hashing algorithm map it to some sort of output data (called a hash). This output data should be deterministic, meaning for each input there should be 1 output when put through our hashing algorithm.</description>

    <description>When developing software you have an important choice to make. Should users be able to see the source code to the program youâ€™re asking them to run? Should you be able to know the internals of whatâ€™s happening in your computer? Much of the software we used today is closed source and proprietary, meaning we donâ€™t know how it works, since we canâ€™t view the source code.</description>
